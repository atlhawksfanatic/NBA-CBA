Such certification shall be submitted to the NBA no later than sixty (60) days following the execution of such new Player Contract, or any Renegotiation, Extension, or other amendment of the Player Contract.
(d) If an agent, player, or Team fails or refuses to provide a certification called for under this Article XV, the NBA shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove the transaction in question.
