(c) The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly select an Independent Expert who shall be a person experienced in the field of substance abuse detection and enforcement and shall be authorized to issue Authorizations for Testing in accordance with Section 5 below.
(d) The Medical Director, the SPED Medical Director, and the Independent Expert shall all serve for the duration of this Agreement, unless either the NBA or the Players Association has, by September 1 of any year covered by this Agreement, served written notice of discharge upon the other party and, as appropriate, the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or the Independent Expert. Such notice of discharge shall be effective as of the immediately following September 30; provided, however, that if the parties do not reach agreement by such September 30 as to who shall serve thereafter as the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or the Independent Expert, as the case may be, each party shall, by the immediately following October 15, appoint a person who shall have no relationship to or affiliation with that party. Such persons shall then have until the immediately following December 1 to agree on the appointment of a new Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or Independent Expert. Until a new Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or Independent Expert has been appointed, the previous Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or Independent Expert shall continue to serve.
(e) (i) The NBA and the Players Association shall form a Prohibited Substance Committee, which shall be comprised of one (1) representative from the NBA, one (1) representative from the Players Association, and three (3) individuals jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association who shall be experts in the field of testing and treatment for drugs of abuse and performance-enhancing substances. The members of this Committee shall serve for the duration of the Agreement.
    (ii) The members of the Prohibited Substances Committee shall meet (either in person or by conference call) at least once each Season and once each off-season (the "Annual Meetings"). The Annual Meetings shall be scheduled by the NBA after consultation with the Players Association. At the Annual Meetings, the Committee shall review the Program's list of Prohibited Substances, and discuss general anti-doping issues (including, but not limited to, advances in drug testing science and technology, and modifications to relevant anti-doping policies of other sports organizations). The Committee shall also make recommendations to the NBA and the Players Association for changes to the list of Prohibited Substances (including the determination of laboratory analysis cutoff levels).
    (iii) As of September 1, 2023, and as of each successive September 1, either of the parties to this Agreement may discharge any jointly-selected member of the Prohibited Substances Committee by serving thirty (30) days' prior notice upon that person and upon the other party to this Agreement. In the case of such discharge, or in the event a Committee member resigns, and if the parties are unable to agree on a replacement Committee member within thirty (30) days, then the parties shall request a list of seven (7) names of potential replacements prepared by the Medical Director and any remaining jointly-selected Committee members, and, within seven (7) days, shall select the necessary replacement by alternately striking names from the list until only one (1) remains.
(f) Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Article XXXIII, all costs of the Program in excess of those covered by the NBA Players Group Health Plan, including the fees and expenses of the Medical Director, the SPED Medical Director, the Independent Expert, and the Prohibited Substances Committee shall be shared equally by the NBA and Players Association. The Players Association's share shall be paid by the NBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(g) of this Agreement. The fees and expenses incurred by the NBA in conducting testing pursuant to Sections 5, 6, and 16 below shall be borne by the NBA.
(g) Any and all disputes arising under this Article XXXIII shall be resolved in accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15 of this Agreement; provided, however, that in any challenge to a decision, recommendation, or other conduct of the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, Independent Expert, or Prohibited Substances Committee, or in any challenge to an action or process over which the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director has supervision, the Grievance Arbitrator shall apply an "arbitrary and capricious" standard of review; and provided further that nothing in this Section 2(g) shall limit or otherwise affect Paragraph 19 of the Uniform Player Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party, nor any player or Team, may challenge a determination made by the applicable Program laboratory of whether the estimated or adjusted concentration of a Prohibited Substance that is subject to a confirmatory laboratory analysis level set forth in Exhibit I-6 exceeds the relevant single-point calibrator in a player's "A" and/or "B" sample.

## Confidentiality.

(a) Other than as reasonably required in connection with the suspension or disqualification of a player, the NBA, the Teams, and the Players Association, and all of their members, affiliates, agents, consultants, and employees, are prohibited from publicly disclosing information about the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, test results, compliance, or the fact of participation of a player in the Program ("Program Information"); provided, however, (i) if a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a Drug of Abuse, Diuretic, synthetic cannabinoid, distribution of marijuana, or for failing to comply with his treatment program as prescribed and determined by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable), the NBA may publicly disclose the applicable penalty (but may not, for clarity, publicly disclose the particular Prohibited Substance involved, absent the agreement of the Players Association or the prior disclosure of such information by the player or by a person authorized by the player to disclose such information), and (ii) if a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a SPED, the particular SPED shall be publicly disclosed along with the announcement of the applicable penalty.
(b) The Medical Director, the SPED Medical Director, and the Counselors, and all of their affiliates, agents, consultants, and employees, are prohibited from publicly disclosing Program Information; provided, however, that the Medical Director and the SPED Medical Director shall not be prohibited from disclosing such information to the NBA and the Players Association.
(c) The Independent Expert is prohibited from publicly disclosing any information supplied to him by the NBA or the Players Association pursuant to Section 5 below.
(d) Members of the Prohibited Substances Committee are prohibited from publicly disclosing any information obtained by them in connection with their duties as Committee members. If a jointly-selected member of the Committee violates this Section 3(d), such member shall be immediately discharged from the Committee.
(e) Any Program Information that is publicly disclosed (i) under Section 3(a) above, (ii) by the player, (iii) with the player's authorization, or (iv) through release by sources other than the NBA, NBA Teams, the Players Association, the Medical Director, the Counselors, the SPED Medical Director, the Independent Expert, or the Prohibited Substances Committee, or any of their members, affiliates, agents, consultants, and employees, will, after such disclosure, no longer be subject to the confidentiality provisions of this Section 3.
(f) Other than as reasonably required by the Reasonable Cause Testing procedure set forth in Section 5 below, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall divulge to any other person or entity (including their respective members, affiliates, agents, consultants, employees, and the player and Team involved):
    (i) that it has received information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance by a player;
    (ii) that it is considering requesting, has requested, or has had a conference with the Independent Expert concerning the suspected use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance by a player;
    (iii) any information disclosed to the Independent Expert; or
    (iv) the results of any conference with the Independent Expert.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 3(a)-(f) above, the NBA and the Players Association shall promptly advise and make available to each other all information either of them may have in their possession, custody, or control that provides cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 3(a)-(f) above, if a player (1) has tested positive for a Prohibited Substance and is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification under this Article XXXIII by virtue of such positive test (e.g., because such positive test has not been deemed negative due to a determination by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) that there is a valid alternative medical explanation for the test result, or (2) is otherwise in violation of the Program and, as a result, is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification under this Article XXXIII by reason of such violation (e.g., because of his noncompliance with treatment or failure to cooperate with the testing process), then:
    (i) If, while the player is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above, the player commences or is engaged in negotiations with a Team regarding a Player Contract or an amendment to a Player Contract (including an Extension, Renegotiation, or other amendment), the player shall immediately provide written notice of the positive test and/or the potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification to the Team. (For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "immediately" means (x) if the player commences such negotiations with the Team after being informed that he is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above, upon commencement of such negotiations, and (y) if the player is informed that he is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above after commencing such negotiations with the Team, within twenty-four (24) hours of being so informed, and in the case of either (x) or (y), prior to the execution of any Contract or amendment to such Contract.) If the player enters into a Player Contract or an amendment to a Player Contract with a Team, then the NBA shall promptly inform the Team of the player's positive test and/or potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification and notice obligation pursuant to this Section 3(h)(i). Within six (6) business days of being so informed by the NBA, the Team may request that the NBA render the player's Contract (or amendment, as the case may be) null and void if the Team believes that the player failed to provide the Team with written notice pursuant to this Section 3(h). If a Team makes such a request, and the NBA then determines that the player failed to provide the Team with such written notice, the player's Contract (or amendment, as the case may be) shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect.
    (ii) If, while the player is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above, an assignment of the player's Contract is proposed to occur via a trade conference call with the NBA league office, then the NBA shall provide notice of the positive test and/or potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification, to the Teams involved in the trade of the player's Contract.
    (iii) If, while the player is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above, the player has been placed on waivers and a Team claims the rights to the player, prior to notifying a Team that it has acquired such rights, the NBA shall provide written notice of the positive result and/or potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification to such Team. Upon receiving such notice, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Team shall have the right to withdraw its waiver claim pursuant to a process established by the NBA.
    
    In the event that the NBA provides notice to a Team pursuant to this Section 3(h), the NBA also shall inform the Team of (x) whether the testing of the split or "B" sample of the player's specimen is outstanding, and (y) the further process to which the player is subject under the Program.
(i) Nothing contained in this Section 3 shall prohibit a Team from providing to the NBA information concerning whether a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. For clarity, this Section 3(i) does not permit a Team to provide information to the NBA in violation of Section 18(d) below.

## Testing.

(a) Testing conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII, whether by the NBA, the Medical Director, or the SPED Medical Director, shall be conducted in compliance with scientifically accepted analytical techniques. Such testing shall also comply with Section 4(b) below, the collection procedures described in Exhibit I-3 (for urine collections) and Exhibit I-4 (for blood collections) to this Agreement, and such additional procedures and protocols as may be established by the NBA (after consultation with the Players Association) or the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the NBA and the Players Association). The NBA and the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the Players Association), are authorized to retain such consultants and support services as are necessary and appropriate to administer and conduct such testing.
(b) If a player is selected for random drug testing pursuant to Section 6 below on a day he is scheduled to play a game, the following additional procedures will apply: (i) any blood testing must occur after the game; and (ii) for urine testing of a player on the visiting Team scheduled at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the shoot-around for that Team commences, and for any tests that are not completed by the time the visiting Team bus is scheduled to leave the arena or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the Team will provide alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and accompanies him or them back to the Team's hotel.
(c) All tests conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII shall be analyzed by laboratories selected by the NBA and the Players Association, and certified by the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
(d) Any test conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII will be considered "positive" for a Prohibited Substance under the following circumstances:
    (i) If the test is for a Prohibited Substance other than a SPED or Diuretic and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-5.
    (ii) If the test is for a SPED or Diuretic, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-6.
    (iii) If a player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only); provided, however, that the NBA will use its best efforts (A) to have the drug testing collectors immediately notify the NBA when any player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, and (B) to provide such information to the Players Association as soon as possible thereafter; and provided, further, that (C) following any player's refusal to submit to a test or failure to cooperate fully with the testing process, the drug testing collector shall wait ninety (90) minutes at the collection site, and (D) if the player submits to the test and cooperates fully with the testing process within such additional time, then his earlier refusal or failure to cooperate shall be excused and the test shall not be deemed positive under this Section 4(d).
    (iv) If the player fails to submit to a scheduled test, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only).
    (v) If the player attempts to substitute, dilute, or adulterate a specimen sample or in any other manner alter a test result (other than by testing positive for a Diuretic).
(e) The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of any positive test conducted by the NBA, and shall thereafter notify the player. The Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable) shall promptly notify the player of any positive test conducted by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable); provided, however, that if the positive test will result in a penalty to be imposed on the player, the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) shall notify the NBA and the Players Association of the positive test result and the NBA shall thereafter notify the player of such result and such penalty.
(f) Upon notifying the Players Association of any positive test or atypical finding of an "A" sample, the NBA shall direct the testing of the split or "B" sample of the player's specimen. The test of the "B" sample will be performed at a laboratory other than the laboratory that performed the test of the original or "A" sample. Any such test shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 4. The NBA will notify the Players Association of the result of the test of the player's "B" sample and, if the result is positive, the Players Association may, within five (5) business days of the date of such notification, direct the NBA to request documentation package(s) for the player's "A" sample and "B" sample from the applicable Program laboratory. Within ten (10) business days of receiving a documentation package pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Players Association may hold a conference call among the NBA, the Players Association, and the applicable Program laboratory to request clarification of any information in such documentation package; provided, however, if it is impracticable to hold such conference call within ten (10) business days of receiving a documentation package, then the Players Association may instead seek clarification of any information in the documentation package via an email to the applicable Program laboratory (with the NBA copied), which email must be sent within ten (10) business days of receiving a respective documentation package.
(g) Any positive test pursuant to Section 4(d)(i) above shall be reviewed by the Medical Director. Any positive test pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii) above shall be reviewed by the SPED Medical Director. If the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) determines, in his or her professional judgment, that there is a valid alternative medical explanation for such positive test result, then the test shall be deemed negative.
(h) If the test result for any player is reported by the laboratory as "invalid" or "endogenous steroids abnormally low," the NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association, and shall thereafter notify the player. In the event of such a test result, the player shall be required to submit to another test on a date determined by the NBA that is not more than thirty (30) days after the date of the original test (the "Re-Test"). If the Re-Test results in (i) a positive test for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine or a positive test under Section 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) below; (ii) a positive test for a synthetic cannabinoid, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 10 below; (iii) a positive test for a SPED or Benzodiazepine, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below; or (iv) a positive test for a Diuretic, the player shall be deemed to have tested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below. The original test will not be counted towards the number of tests to be administered to that player for that Season under Section 6 (Random Testing) below.
(i) For clarity, if the test result for any player reports a SPED or Diuretic at a detectable level below the confirmatory laboratory analysis levels set forth in Exhibit I-6 (and, for clenbuterol, above 0.2 ng/ml but below 1 ng/ml), the result shall be treated as an atypical finding under the Program and, as a result, the player shall be subject to testing for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing on the date the NBA is notified by the applicable Program laboratory of the atypical finding. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.

## Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing.

(a) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association has information that gives it reasonable cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, including information that a First-Year Player may have been engaged in such conduct during the period beginning three (3) months prior to his entry into the NBA, such party shall request a conference with the other party and the Independent Expert, which shall be held within twenty-four (24) hours or as soon thereafter as the Expert is available. Upon hearing the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player.
(b) In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent Expert shall use his or her independent judgment based upon his or her experience in substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources, and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.
(c) Immediately upon the Independent Expert's issuance of an Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for synthetic cannabinoids (if the authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of synthetic cannabinoids), or for SPEDs (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player's use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.
(d) In the event that the player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine pursuant to this Section 5, or tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section 5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) below. If the player tests positive for a SPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the Authorization for Testing was issued.
(e) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, has engaged in a felony involving the distribution of marijuana, or has received treatment for use of a Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth in Sections 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a Prohibited Substance, has engaged in a felony involving the distribution of marijuana, or has received treatment other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) below, notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed a SPED, Benzodiazepine, Diuretic, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 below, as the case may be.

## Random Testing.

(a) In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a player shall be required to undergo urine testing for Prohibited Substances at any time, without prior notice to the player, no more than four (4) times each Season and no more than two (2) times during each Off-Season. For purposes of this Section 6, the last day of a Season for a player shall be the day before that player's Off-Season begins. During each Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 1,925 total urine tests. During the Off-Season, the NBA will conduct no more than 600 total urine tests. The scheduling of testing and collection of urine samples will be conducted according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team, or any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provide advance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location. Urine samples collected during the Season will be tested for all Prohibited Substances; urine samples collected during the Off-Season will be tested for SPEDs and Diuretics only and may not under any circumstances be tested with respect to any other Prohibited Substances.
(b) (i) In the event that a First-Year Player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine pursuant to this Section 6, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams for a period of one (1) year, his Player Contract shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract), and he shall enter Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program. Such dismissal and disqualification shall be mandatory and may not be rescinded or reduced by the player's Team or the NBA; provided, however, that such dismissal and disqualification may be reduced or rescinded by the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with Section 20 below.
    (ii) During any period while a First-Year Player is dismissed and disqualified from the NBA under Section 6(b)(i) above, and so long as such player is in compliance with his in-patient or aftercare obligations under the Program (as determined by the Medical Director), he shall receive from his Team a reasonable and necessary living expense stipend to be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association which (A) shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Salary that the player would otherwise have been entitled to earn for the period of his dismissal and disqualification and (B) shall not be payable for more than one (1) year from the date of such dismissal and disqualification.

(b) In addition to any other provision of this Agreement requiring that a player be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) above, a player will also be dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above if he is convicted of (including by a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere to) a crime involving the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance other than marijuana or a felony involving the distribution of marijuana.

## Reinstatement.

(a) After a period of at least one (1) year from the time of a player's dismissal and disqualification under Section 12(a) above, such player may apply for reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player's dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player's conduct since his dismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.
(b) For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the opinion of the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable), successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable). For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above in connection with a Drug of Abuse, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Drug of Abuse or synthetic cannabinoid within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her professional judgment, for marijuana and/or alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed. For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above in connection with a SPED, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine and/or blood testing acceptable to the SPED Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive for a SPED within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.
(c) The granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.
(d) Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this Section 13.
(e) In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to Section 6(b) above is approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been rendered null and void pursuant to Section 6(b) above, shall be deemed not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any NBA Team, except as specifically provided in this Section 13.
(f) (i) A First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team"). Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 13(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but not more than the Salary provided for in Section 13(f)(iii) below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
    (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(f)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 13(f)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which the player serves the notice required by Section 13(f)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering playing services under a Player Contract with such Team, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such team.
    (iii) A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(a)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player's new Contract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player's new Contract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the Player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new Contract, then the player's Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.
(g) (i) A Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the "previous Team"). Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 13(g)(iii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the rest of that Season) and calling for a Salary in the first Season covered by the Tender at least equal to the lesser of (A) the player's Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified, or (B) the Estimated Average Player Salary during the then-current Season, in either case reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season covered by the Tender is a partial Season, but not greater than the Salary provided in Section 13(g)(iv) below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
    (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(g)(i) above, a Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and who (A) had completed the playing services called for under his Player Contract with the previous Team at the time of his dismissal and disqualification, and (B) would have been an Unrestricted Free Agent on the July 1 following his dismissal and disqualification, shall be an Unrestricted Free Agent upon being reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and need not serve the notice to his previous Team described in Section 13(g)(i) above. For clarity, a Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and would not have been an Unrestricted Free Agent on the July 1 following his dismissal and disqualification (including a Veteran Player who had completed the playing services called for under his Player Contract with his previous Team at the time of his dismissal and disqualification and who would have been a Restricted Free Agent on the July 1 following his dismissal and disqualification) shall be subject to the process described in Section 13(g)(i) above.
    (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 13(g)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team or league not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team or league not in the NBA at any point after the date on which he serves the notice required by Section 13(g)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin rendering playing services for such Team immediately, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such Team.
    (iv) A Veteran Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and enters into a Player Contract with his previous Team may enter into a Player Contract with such Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the player's Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(a)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player's new Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons (including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that remained under the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary called for in any Season of the Player's new Contract (including any Option Year), may not exceed the Salary called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the player's Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the player's Team ultimately exercises the Option Year available under the new Contract, then such Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player's Rookie Scale Contract.

## Exclusivity.

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be no other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the NBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing; provided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test players solely for diagnostic purposes in order to provide satisfactory medical care. The results of any diagnostic drug testing conducted pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be used for any other purpose by the player's Team or the NBA. If any Team is found to have tested a player in violation of this Section 14, the NBA will impose a substantial fine not to exceed \$750,000 upon such Team pursuant to the NBA's Constitution and By-Laws.
(b) The penalties set forth in this Article XXXIII shall be the exclusive penalties to be imposed upon a player for the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.
(c) No Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date hereof shall include any term or provision that modifies, contradicts, changes, or is inconsistent with Paragraph 8 of such Contract (including any condition or limitation on salary protection other than the standard conditions or limitations specifically provided for in Article II, Section 4) or provides for the testing of a player for illegal substances. Any term or provision of a currently effective Uniform Player Contract that is inconsistent with Paragraph 8 of such Contract shall be deemed null and void only to the extent of the inconsistency.

## Random HGH Blood Testing.

(a) In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a player shall be required to undergo HGH Blood Testing at any time, without prior notice to the player, no more than two (2) times each Season and no more than one (1) time during each Off-Season. For purposes of this Section 15, the last day of a Season for a player shall be the day before that player's Off-Season begins. The scheduling of testing and collection of blood samples will be conducted according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team, or any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provide advance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location. HGH Blood Testing may also take place under Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing) and Section 9 (Steroids and Performance-Enhancing Drugs Program) above, and Section 16 (Additional Bases for Testing) below. (For clarity, the number of random blood tests for Human Growth Hormone pursuant to this Section 15 shall be in addition to the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited Substances called for in Section 6 above.) HGH Blood Testing may occur at the same time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs, subject to the procedures governing game-day blood testing set forth in Section 4(b) above and Exhibit I-4 to this Agreement.
(b) In the event that a player tests positive for a Human Growth Hormone pursuant to this Section 15, he shall enter the SPED Program and suffer the consequences set forth in Section 9 above.
(c) The isoform test for HGH blood testing will be used with corresponding decision limits issued by the World Anti-Doping Agency in December of 2020 (the "WADA Decision Limits") for positive test results. (The WADA Decision Limits are 1.84 for kit 1 and 1.91 for kit 2 for male athletes.)

## Additional Bases for Testing.

(a) Any player who seeks treatment outside the Program for a problem involving a Prohibited Substance, marijuana, or alcohol shall, as directed by the NBA (after notice to the Players Association), submit himself to an evaluation by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) and provide (or cause to be provided) to the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) such medical and treatment records as the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) may request. The Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) may, in his or her professional judgment, also require such a player, without prior notice, to submit to testing for Prohibited Substances, provided that the frequency of such testing shall not exceed three (3) times per week and the duration of such testing shall not exceed one (1) year from the date of the player's initial evaluation by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable).
(b) Any player who is subject to in-patient or aftercare treatment in the Program and is formally charged with "driving while intoxicated," "driving under the influence of alcohol," or any other crime or offense involving suspected alcohol, marijuana, or illegal substance use shall, provided that the NBA has advised the Players Association, be required to submit to a urine test, to be conducted by the NBA, within seven (7) days of being so charged.
(c) If, pursuant to Section 16(a) above, a player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine; (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above; or (iii) refuses or fails to submit to an evaluation or provide (or cause to be provided) the information requested by the Medical Director, but does not Come Forward Voluntarily within sixty (60) days of being requested to do so by the NBA (with notice to the Players Association), or if, pursuant to Section 16(b) above, a player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine, then, in either case the player shall advance two stages in the Drugs of Abuse Program—i.e., the player shall enter Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program (if the player had not previously entered Stage 1 of such Program), and the player shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) above (if the player had previously entered Stage 1 or Stage 2 of such Program).
(d) If, pursuant to Section 16(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for a SPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 above, as the case may be. If, pursuant to Section 16(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall be deemed to have tested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 above.
(e) If a player is or, within the previous six (6) months, (i) has been in possession of any device or product used or designed for substituting, diluting, or adulterating a specimen sample, or (ii) has been subject to a finding by another sports league or anti-doping organization that he has substituted, diluted, or adulterated a specimen sample and that finding has not been overturned on appeal, that player shall be required to undergo testing for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the six-week period following his notification by the NBA of the commencement of such testing. If the player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine or (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above, he shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) above. If the player tests positive for a SPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 above, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall be deemed to have tested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 above. A player who tests positive for a Drug of Abuse or a SPED pursuant to this Section 16(e) may have his dismissal and disqualification or other penalty reduced or rescinded by the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with Section 20 below.
(f) Nothing in this Section 16 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions of Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing).

## Additional Prohibited Substances and Testing Methods.

(a) Any steroid or performance-enhancing drug that is declared illegal during the term of this Agreement will automatically be added to the list of Prohibited Substances as a SPED.
(b) At any time during the term of this Agreement, either the NBA or the Players Association may convene a meeting of the Prohibited Substances Committee to request that a substance or substances be added to the list of Prohibited Substances set forth on Exhibit I-2 to this Agreement. Any such addition of a Prohibited Substance may only include a substance that is or is reasonably likely to be harmful to Players and is or is reasonably likely to be improperly performance-enhancing. The determination of the Committee to add to the list of Prohibited Substances shall be made by a majority vote of all five (5) Committee members, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable.
(c) Players will receive notice of any addition to the list of Prohibited Substances six (6) months prior to the date on which such addition becomes effective under this Article XXXIII.
(d) At any time during the term of this Agreement, either the NBA or the Players Association may convene a meeting of the Prohibited Substances Committee to request that a testing method be added to the Program. Pursuant to this Section 17(d), the Prohibited Substances Committee shall have the authority to: (i) determine what testing methods will be used to detect newly added Prohibited Substances under the Program, if such Prohibited Substances are detected by methods not currently used by the Program's laboratories; and (ii) approve the use of new testing methods for current Prohibited Substances when such methods have been developed or validated during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Prohibited Substances Committee shall not have the authority to add a testing method that would require a change to the manner in which specimens are collected from players (such as a change from urine collections to blood collections). Any determination of the Committee pursuant to this Section 17(d) shall be made by a majority vote of all five (5) Committee members, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable.

## Prescriptions Under the Anti-Drug Program.

(a) Notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions of Section 3 of this Article XXXIII, before any player is prescribed a drug or substance (whether or not it is a Prohibited Substance) as part of his treatment in the Program, the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) will notify the designated physician of the player's team of the name of the drug or substance (the "Proposed Substance"), the medical justification for the prescription of the Proposed Substance, and the name of the prescribing physician.
(b) If the designated physician of the player's team advises the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) – at that time or at any time thereafter – that the Proposed Substance would create a possible adverse reaction with another prescription substance that the player is being administered, a discussion will be held among the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable), the prescribing physician, and the designated team physician with respect to modifying one or both of the prescriptions so as to avoid the potential adverse reaction.
(c) If the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) becomes aware that a player has been traded to or signed with another team after notification has been made to a designated team physician under Section 18(a) above, the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) is required to make the same notification to the designated team physician of the player's new team and to have the discussion required by Section 18(b) above.
(d) A team physician who receives a notification from the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) under this Section 18 may only disclose the prescription for the Proposed Substance to other members of the team medical staff who are required to be advised of the prescription in order to ensure that the player is receiving proper medical care from the team's medical staff, and to no other person.

## Longitudinal Profile for Exogenous Testosterone.

(a) A longitudinal profile for exogenous testosterone will be established for each player (the "Longitudinal Profile"). The sole purpose of the Longitudinal Profile is to assist the laboratory selected by the parties to perform the analysis of primary specimens for urine tests under the Program (the "Laboratory") in determining which specimens shall be subjected to carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry ("IRMS") analysis.
(b) Players' Longitudinal Profiles will be created pursuant to the protocol set forth in Exhibit I-7. The three (3) tests used to create the Longitudinal Profiles will be random tests conducted under Section 6 above, and the creation of the Longitudinal Profiles will not require any player to undergo any testing in addition to the required random testing set forth in Section 6 above.
(c) Once a player's Longitudinal Profile is established, the director of the Laboratory will consider the player's Baseline Values (as defined in Exhibit I-7) in comparison to the normalized Testosterone concentration, normalized Epitestosterone concentration or the corresponding Baseline Testosterone/Epitestosterone ratio (collectively, the "Specimen Values") of the player's subsequent urine specimens and will determine, in his or her discretion, whether to conduct an IRMS analysis on a urine specimen. In addition, the Laboratory will randomly select urine specimens for IRMS analysis to ensure that such analysis is conducted on at least one (1) urine specimen from every player during each year covered by the Program (i.e., from October 1 through September 30). The decision regarding whether to conduct IRMS analysis on a urine specimen for any other reason will remain in the discretion of the director of the Laboratory.

## No Significant Fault or Negligence by Player.

(a) If a player proves by clear and convincing evidence that he bears no significant fault or negligence for the presence of a Drug of Abuse or a SPED in his test result, the Grievance Arbitrator may, in a proceeding brought under Article XXXI of this Agreement, reduce or rescind the penalty otherwise applicable under this Article XXXIII. Such reduction or rescission (if any) will be determined at the discretion of the Grievance Arbitrator.
(b) For purposes of this Section 20, "no significant fault or negligence" means the unusual circumstance in which the Player did not know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected, even with the exercise of considerable caution and diligence, that he was taking, ingesting, applying, or otherwise using the Drug of Abuse or SPED. To show that he bears no significant fault or negligence, the Player must also establish how the Drug of Abuse or SPED entered his system. A Player cannot satisfy his burden by merely denying that he intentionally used the Drug of Abuse or SPED.

## G League Suspensions.

Any player suspended under the NBAGL anti-drug program who signs a Uniform Player Contract before the full term of the suspension is served shall continue to serve the suspension in the NBA for the lesser of: (i) the number of games remaining on the suspension imposed under the NBAGL anti-drug program when the player signs the Player Contract, or (ii) the difference between the maximum number of games for which the player could have been suspended under the Program for the same violation and the number of games of the suspension already served by the player in the NBAGL. In addition, any player suspended under the NBAGL anti-drug program whose NBAGL contract ends before the full term of the suspension is served shall be subject to Article VI, Section 1(c) of this Agreement with respect to the NBAGL suspension if, at the start of the following NBA Regular Season, he is a Free Agent who has games remaining to be served on the NBAGL suspension. For purposes of Article VI, Section 1(c), the "Team to which he was under contract when the suspension was imposed" shall be deemed to be the NBA Team, if any, with which the player first signs a Player Contract following imposition of the NBAGL suspension.
