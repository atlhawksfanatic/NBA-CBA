Section 1. NBAGL Work Assignments.
(a) An NBA Team may at any time assign a player (other than a
Two-Way Player) on its Active List or Inactive List to an NBAGL team,
provided that the player (i) has either zero (0), one (1), or two (2) Years of
Service at the time of the assignment, or (ii) has more than two (2) Years of
Service at the time of the assignment and the player and the Players
Association consent to such assignment in writing. Upon such assignment
("NBAGL Work Assignment"), the player will be placed on the NBA
Team's Inactive List, and shall (A) report to the NBAGL team (and render
for the NBAGL team such services as the player is required to render for
the NBA Team under his Uniform Player Contract and this Agreement),
and (B) at the direction of the NBA Team, subsequently return and report
to, and resume the performance of services for, the NBA Team. An
NBAGL Work Assignment commences when the player reports in-person
to the NBAGL team, and ends either when the player, upon being recalled,
reports back to his NBA Team or when the NBAGL Season concludes.
(b) There shall be no limit on the number of NBAGL Work
Assignments given to a player. No NBA Team shall issue an NBAGL Work
Assignment for the purpose of disciplining a player for misconduct or
retaliating against a player for exercising any right that he has under this

and recall of players to the NBAGL provided that such rules do not violate
the provisions of this Article XLI.

forty-eight (48) hours after such notice is received by the player.(b) If the player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the
NBAGL team or NBA Team, whichever is applicable, within the time
provided in Section 2(a) above, the player may be fined and/or suspended
without pay by the NBA Team until such time as he reports. In addition,
such failure to report, without a reasonable excuse, shall constitute conduct

however to the One Penalty rule set forth in Article VI, Section 10.
Section 3. Travel and Relocation Expenses.
A player's NBA Team shall be obligated to reimburse the player for his

except if the suspension is for more than five (5) games, in
which case the player must be transferred to the Team's
Two-Way List following the fifth game of the suspension.

entities (including, without limitation, NBAGL teams), shall
have the right to use, and to license others to use, such

broadcast or telecast, including over-the-air television, cable
television, pay television, direct broadcast satellite television,and any form of cassette, cartridge, disk system, or other
means of distribution known or unknown.

related entities (including, without limitation, NBA Teams), and/or the
NBAGL and its related entities (including, without limitation, NBAGL
teams), to use or authorize others to use the Player's Player Attributes in
a manner that constitutes an unauthorized Endorsement or an

clarified in Article XXVIII of this Agreement and Paragraph 14 of the
Uniform Player Contract). For purposes of clarity and without limitation,
any use of a player's Player Attributes that has been expressly authorized
by the player (not including the Uniform Player Contract) shall not be an
unauthorized Endorsement or an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion.

Teams in Article XXVIII, Section 3 (Unauthorized
Endorsement/Sponsor Promotion) shall apply to the NBAGL and
NBAGL teams.

appearances while on NBAGL Work Assignment or NBAGL Two-Way
Service each Season to the NBAGL or his NBAGL team.
