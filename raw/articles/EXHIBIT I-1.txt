URINE COLLECTION PROCEDURES
During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to
occur before practices on non-game days, and before shoot-arounds and
games on game days. For random drug testing of a visiting team scheduled
at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the
shoot-around for that team commences, and for any tests that are not
completed by the time the visiting team bus is scheduled to leave the arena
or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the team will provide
alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at
the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure
that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and
accompanies him or them back to the Team's hotel. Random drug tests can
be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.
When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that
the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or
identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.
The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player
will then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of the
collector.
The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen
of sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot
immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at
the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a
specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a
sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the
presence of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle
will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and the other will be used as
the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with
tamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a
unique identification number that corresponds to the number on the chain
of custody form.The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which
may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the
specimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen
on the chain of custody form. Both the player and collector will sign the
chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed and sent via an overnight
delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody
form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the two specimens that
is sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory. If an electronic
chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.
Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive or produces an atypical
finding, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available
for testing by a different laboratory, if directed by the NBA.EXHIBIT I-4
BLOOD COLLECTION PROCEDURES
During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to
occur after practices on non-game days, and after games on game days.
Random tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.
When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that
the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or
identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.
The player will be asked to select one (1) dried blood spot collection kit
and one (1) security kit that will be used to transport the specimen.
The collector shall collect a total of four (4) blood spots. The player's
non-dominant arm will be used to make the initial blood draw attempt. If
the blood draw is not possible or successful from the non-dominant arm,
the dominant arm may be used. In the event that the collector determines
that there is no suitable location on the dominant or non-dominant arm due
to excessive hair or heavy tattoo ink, the player's thigh may be used as an
alternate draw site. No more than three (3) attempts will be made to draw
a blood specimen. After that, the collection will be discontinued. Upon
completing the blood draw, the collector will ensure that the draw site is not
bleeding and bandage the site.
The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which
may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the
specimens. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form.
The specimen will be sealed in a blood specimen bag and sent via an
overnight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy
chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the
two specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory.
If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the
laboratory electronically.Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive or produces an atypical
finding, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available
for testing by a different laboratory, if directed by the NBA.EXHIBIT I-5

CREATION OF PLAYER LONGITUDINAL PROFILES
The following protocol will be used to create the Longitudinal
Profiles described in Article XXXIII, Section 19 above:
Step 1: The Program's drug collection company will assign
each player a unique personal identification number. A
player's personal identification number will remain the same
for all periods of time he is covered by the Program, and will
only be used for the purposes of the Longitudinal Profile.
Other than to the designated representatives or employees
within the drug collection company and the Laboratory, the
drug collection company will not disclose the personal
identification number that corresponds to the player's name
to any individual other than one representative each of the
NBA and the Players Association.
Step 2: The Laboratory (as defined in Article XXXIII,
Section 19(a)) will maintain a secure, separate database for
each player's personal identification number that contains
his corresponding Testosterone concentration,
epitestosterone concentration and Testosterone/
Epitestosterone ("T/E") ratio (referred to collectively as the
"Baseline Values"). This database will not contain any
identifying information for the players.
Step 3: The Baseline Values will be calculated, pursuant to
the Laboratory's operating standards, by averaging a player's
T/E ratio, Testosterone concentration and Epitestosterone
concentration, respectively, from three (3) negative tests
conducted under the Program. After a player's Baseline
Values are established, those values will be considered a
player's Longitudinal Profile for the duration of his coverage
under the Program. New Baseline Values will be calculated
for a player upon the recommendation of the director of the
Laboratory.Step 4: The Laboratory will compare the Baseline Values to
the corresponding Specimen Values (as defined in
Article XXXIII, Section 19(c)) in subsequent tests identified
with a player's personal identification number in
determining whether it will conduct IRMS analysis (as
defined in Section 19(a)) on a urine specimen.
