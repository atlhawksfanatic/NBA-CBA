Section 3. NBA Physicians Association.
Representatives designated by the Players Association shall participate in
meetings of the NBA Physicians Association for the purpose of discussing
matters related to the medical care and treatment of players.Section 4. Disclosure of Medical Information.
(a) A Team physician may disclose all relevant medical information
concerning a player to (i) the General Manager, coaches, and trainers of the
Team by which such player is employed, (ii) any entity from which any such
Team seeks to procure, or has procured, an insurance policy covering such
player's life or any disability, injury, illness, or other medical condition such

below, the media or public on behalf of the Team.
(b) Should it be requested in connection with the contemplated
assignment of a player's Uniform Player Contract to one or more NBA
Teams, a Team's physician may furnish all relevant medical information
relating to the player to (i) the physicians and General Manager, coaches,
and trainers of such other Team or Teams, and (ii) any entity from which
any such other Team seeks to procure, or has procured, an insurance policy
covering such player's life or any disability, injury, illness, or other medical
condition such player may suffer or sustain.
(c) Should a Team assign a player to the NBAGL, such Team's
physician may furnish all relevant medical information relating to the player

an NBAGL team physician may furnish all relevant medical information
relating to the player to the physicians and General Manager, coaches, and
trainers of the player's Team.
(d) Subject to Section 4(e) below, each Team may make public medical
information relating to the players in its employ, provided that such
information relates solely to the reasons why any such player has not been
or is not rendering services as a player. If a player, in the judgment of the
Team, is expected to be unable to participate in any basketball practice or
game due to an injury, illness, or other medical condition for a period of two
or more weeks, the Team's first public statement regarding such player's
injury, illness, or other medical condition may only describe such injury,
illness, or other medical condition and the anticipated date when such player
will be re-evaluated by the Team. The Team may make subsequent publicstatement(s) with all relevant medical information only after such
re-evaluation has occurred.
(e) A player or his immediate family (where appropriate) shall have the
right to approve the terms and timing of any public release of medical
information relating to any injuries, illnesses, or other medical conditions
suffered by that player that are potentially life- or career-threatening, or that
do not arise from the player's participation in NBA games or practices. If a
Team or the NBA requests such approval and the player or his immediate
family (where appropriate) does not provide it, then the Team is limited to
disclosing that an injury, illness, or other medical condition is preventing a
player from rendering services to the Team and that the anticipated length
of the player's absence from rendering services to the Team is unknown.
(f) Nothing in Sections 4(d)-(e) shall limit a Team from disclosing
medical information related to an injury, illness, or other medical condition
with respect to any player who has made medical information available
publicly that is inconsistent with the written opinion of a Team physician.
(g) In addition to the access set forth in Article XXII, Section 8 of the
CBA below, a player is entitled access to his own medical records and the
Team shall use best efforts to provide such information on or before
forty-eight (48) business hours of a player request.
Section 5. Vaccination Education and Recommendations.
The NBA and the Players Association shall, at least annually, jointly
recommend, and issue educational materials to players (in connection with
the Rookie Transition Program and Team Awareness Meetings described in
Article VI, Section 4 of the CBA and via written materials provided to all
players) regarding, the health benefits of vaccinations recommended by the
CDC (i.e., as of the effective date of this Agreement, COVID-19, measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR), influenza, tetanus and pertussis, varicella
(chicken pox), Hepatitis B) and the meningococcal vaccine.
Section 6. Selection of Team Physician and Other Health Care
Providers.
Each Team has the sole and exclusive discretion to select any doctors,
hospitals, clinics, health consultants, or other health care providers ("Health
Care Providers") to examine and/or treat players pursuant to the terms ofthis Agreement and the Uniform Player Contract; provided, however, no
Team will engage any such Health Care Provider based primarily on a
sponsorship relationship (or lack thereof) with the Team, and without
considering the Health Care Provider's qualifications (including, e.g., medical
experience and credentials) and the goal of providing high quality care to all
of its players.
Section 7. Health and Performance Screenings.
Players shall undergo reasonable screening and baseline testing
(e.g., pursuant to NBA cardiac and concussion protocols) and, in connection
with such screening and testing, shall accurately and completely answer all
reasonable health questions (including, upon request, providing accurate and
complete medical histories). Players additionally shall participate in any
league-wide biomechanics screening and assessment program upon request
and direction by the NBA, provided that, prior to implementing any such
program, the NBA shall consult with the Players Association, and provided
further that any such assessment program shall require no more than
four (4) assessments for any one Season. Any other new league-wide
performance screening and assessment program directed by the NBA and
required for players shall require prior agreement of the NBA and the
Players Association.
Section 8. Electronic Medical Records.
(a) The NBA will use, during the Term, an electronic medical records
system ("EMR") that will provide a secure, searchable, centralized database
of player health information. To the extent health information disclosures
are permitted by this Agreement (including the Uniform Player Contract),
such disclosures may be made via secure systems within the EMR. In
addition, the EMR will: (i) allow for the NBA (but not the Teams) to
conduct player health and safety reviews; (ii) allow for authorized academic
researchers to access the data (on a de-identified basis) and conduct studies
designed to improve player health and broaden medical knowledge
(provided that the Players Association will be provided with notice prior to
any such access and gives its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld); and (iii) give players the ability to easily access their own health
information and to grant access to such information to physicians of their
choice both during and after their careers.(b) To satisfy the requirement in Section 8(a)(iii) above, by no later than
the end of the 2023-24 Season, the NBA shall make available a mobile app
for exclusive use by players to facilitate direct access for each player to such
information in the EMR. The NBA shall also provide the same or similar
access through the app for exclusive use by former players in respect of
whom the EMR contains medical information. Following the 2023-24
Season, and annually following each Season thereafter, the NBA shall
provide a Players Association-designated physician with a summary report
for each player, which will summarize information on such player from the
EMR (identified by player name) regarding such player's injuries, illnesses,
or medical conditions, imaging studies, prescription medications, surgeries,
vaccinations, concussions and concussion evaluation, and cardiac screening.
In order to confirm player consent for the NBA to provide the above
summary and related information to the Players Association, the NBA shall
include in the NBA's health information authorization, which in accordance
with Paragraph 7(i) of the UPC each player is required to sign annually, an
authorization for the NBA to provide medical records to the Players
Association.
Section 9. Concussion, Cardiac, and Emergency Medical
Preparedness Policies.
(a) A concussion policy designed to maximize the neurological health
of players shall be in effect during the Term. The concussion policy will be
reviewed and updated periodically by the NBA in conjunction with the NBA
Physicians Association and the NBA's Concussion Advisory Committee in
order to keep the policy current and consistent with the evolving science of
concussion management. Prior to any update to the concussion policy, the
NBA shall consult with the Players Association.
(b) A cardiac screening policy designed to identify cardiovascular risks
for players shall be in effect during the Term. The cardiac screening policy
will be reviewed and updated periodically by the NBA in conjunction with
the NBA Physicians Association and the NBA's Cardiac Advisory
Committee in order to keep the policy current and consistent with the
evolving science of sports cardiology. Prior to any update to the cardiac
screening policy, the NBA shall consult with the Players Association.
(c) A policy for response to medical emergencies designed to provide a
framework for a rapid response to on-court emergencies shall be in effectduring the Term. The emergency medical preparedness policy will be
reviewed and updated periodically by the NBA in conjunction with the NBA
Physicians Association and the NBA's Emergency Medical Preparedness
Committee in order to keep the policy current and consistent with
recommendations from organizations and experts with emergency response
expertise. Prior to any update to the emergency medical preparedness
policy, the NBA shall consult with the Players Association.
Section 10. Second Opinion.
(a) Subject to the additional terms in subsections (b) through (e) below,
players shall have the right to receive a second medical opinion at the Team's
expense regarding the course of treatment for an injury, illness, or other
medical condition that either: (i) has prevented the player from participating
in a Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff game for two (2) weeks or more; (ii)
in the opinion of a Team physician for the player's Team, is more likely than
not to prevent the player from being able to participate in an NBA game for
two (2) weeks or more (or during the off-season, from participating in
competitive basketball without restriction for two weeks or more); (iii) in
the opinion of the Team physician will not be significantly aggravated by the
player continuing to participate in NBA games (or during the offseason
participating in basketball without restriction) when the player reasonably
believes that continued participation will significantly aggravate his injury,
illness, or other medical condition; (iv) results in direction from the Team
physician that the player should undergo surgery; or (v) results in direction
from the Team physician that the player should not undergo surgery when
the player reasonably believes that surgery is necessary for the injury, illness,
or other medical condition. The foregoing shall not limit a player's ability
to obtain a second medical opinion in circumstances other than those set
forth in Sections 10(a)(i)-(v) above, provided that the Team shall not be
obligated to pay for or consider any such second opinion.
(b) The parties will maintain and publish annually a list (the "Second
Opinion List") of jointly-appointed medical specialists, including one or
more psychiatrist(s) (each a "Second Opinion Physician"), by specialty and
by geographic region in the United States and Canada, to provide players
with the second medical opinions described in subsection (a) above. At least
two (2) board-certified physicians shall be designated as Second Opinion
Physicians for each specialty in each of the geographic regions.(c) Each Second Opinion Physician will be included on the Second
Opinion List for the duration of this Agreement, unless either the NBA or
the Players Association has provided written notice to the other party that a
physician should be removed from the Second Opinion List (i) by
December 1 of any year covered by this Agreement; or (ii) at any time of
any year covered by this Agreement, for failure to provide a player's Team
with all information relating to a consultation with the player within two (2)
business days following the consultation; provided that, for the first such
failure, a party is required to issue a warning to the Second Opinion
Physician (following written notice to the other party), with removal
permitted thereafter if the Second Opinion Physician does not provide the
player's Team with all information relating to such consultation within
two (2) business days following the warning, or for the second or any
additional instances in which the Second Opinion Physician does not timely
provide a player's Team with all information relating to a consultation with
the player. Such removal shall be effective immediately, provided that,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties, such removal shall not affect any
second opinion process involving such Physician that has previously been
requested by a player.
(d) Prior to obtaining a second opinion, a player shall notify the Team
in writing of his decision to seek such second opinion, the name of the
physician who will be performing the evaluation, and the date and location
of the evaluation. Upon receiving such notice and prior to the player's
evaluation, the Team will make available to the physician relevant medical
information regarding the player.
(e) If, pursuant to subsections (a) through (d) above, a player obtains a
second opinion from a Second Opinion Physician, the Team will pay the
medical costs associated with the second opinion provided such cost is
reasonable for the consultation.
(f) In connection with obtaining a second opinion from a Second
Opinion Physician pursuant to subsections (a) through (e) above, a player
may not be absent from the Team for an unreasonable period of time or
miss any games without authorization of the Team.
(g) If the Second Opinion Physician provides the Team with a written
opinion, and the player has otherwise complied with Paragraph 7(h) of the
UPC, the Team will be required to consider the second opinion inconnection with diagnosis or treatment. For clarity, nothing in this
Section 10 shall be construed to alter or limit in any way the rights of any
Team or the obligation of any player under the CBA or Uniform Player
Contract, including without limitation pursuant to the provisions of
Paragraph 7 of the Uniform Player Contract.
Section 11. Fitness-to-Play.
(a) The parties shall establish panels of physicians (each a
"Fitness-to-Play Panel") for the purpose of determining, as set forth in this
Section 11, whether players with potentially life-threatening injuries,
illnesses, or other medical conditions (or any of the foregoing that have the
potential to result in paralysis or other permanent spinal injury) are medically
able and medically fit to practice and play basketball in the NBA. Each
Fitness-to-Play Panel shall consist of one (1) physician appointed by the
NBA, one (1) physician appointed by the Players Association, and one (1)
physician appointed by agreement of the first two (2) physicians. Each
member of each Panel shall: (i) be board certified and fellowship trained in
his/her field of medical expertise; (ii) be a specialist in the subject matter of
the applicable Fitness-to-Play Panel; and (iii) have at least ten (10) years of
post-fellowship clinical experience. Each Panel will operate by majority
vote, including, but not limited to, its fitness to play determinations. Once
appointed, each physician on a Fitness-to-Play Panel shall be included on
such Panel for the duration of this Agreement, unless either the NBA or the
Players Association has, by December 1 of any year covered by this
Agreement, served written notice to the other party that a physician has been
removed from such Panel. A party may not remove the physician that the
other party appointed to a Fitness-to-Play Panel. In the event that either
party removes a physician from a Fitness-to-Play Panel pursuant to the
foregoing, such removal shall be effective immediately, provided that, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, a physician will continue to serve on the
Fitness-to-Play Panel in respect of any determination on a player's injury,
illness, or other medical condition that has been referred to the Panel but
for which the Panel has not yet issued its written determination.
(b) The parties shall create one or more Fitness-to-Play Panels as are
necessary to address injuries, illnesses, or other medical conditions that are
potentially life-threatening or have the potential to result in paralysis or other
permanent spinal injury for the player (e.g., cardiac illnesses and conditions,
blood clots, and other blood conditions and disorders).(c) If the NBA, a Team, or the Players Association has been advised by
a physician that a player is medically unable and/or medically unfit to
perform his duties as a professional basketball player as a result of a
potentially life-threatening injury, illness, or other medical condition and/or
that performing such duties would likely create a materially elevated risk of
death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal injury for the player, then the
NBA, a Team, or the Players Association may refer the player to a
Fitness-to-Play Panel by making such a referral in writing to the player and
to the NBA, Team, and Players Association, as applicable. Once so referred,
the player will not be permitted to play or practice in the NBA until he is
cleared to do so by the Panel as set forth below.
(d) (1) Upon the referral described in subsection (c) above, the
Panel will be provided with all medical information in the
player's medical file that any member of the Panel deems
relevant to the injury, illness, or other medical condition for
which the player was referred. The Panel will review the
player's injury, illness, or other medical condition (which
review shall include an in-person examination of the player
by each member of the Panel unless such member
determines that an examination by him/her would serve no
useful purpose). Upon conclusion of its review, the Panel
shall provide a report to the NBA, the player's Team, and
the Players Association setting forth its determination and
the reasons therefor.
(2) The determination to be made by the Panel is whether, in
the Panel's reasonable medical judgment and experience,
and having considered current medical knowledge and the
best available objective evidence: (i) the player is medically
able and medically fit to perform his duties as a professional
basketball player; and (ii) performing such duties would not
create a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other
permanent spinal injury for the player. Where there are
authoritative medical guidelines on fitness for athletic
participation and a particular injury, illness, or other medical
condition (e.g., the American Heart Association/American
College of Cardiology Scientific Statements on Eligibility
and Disqualification – Recommendations for CompetitiveAthletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities), the Panel will
consider such guidelines in making its determination.
(3) Subsequent to the player being referred to a Fitness-to-Play
Panel, and prior to the Panel's review of the player's injury,
illness, or other medical condition, the player (on behalf of
himself, his heirs, and assigns) shall be required to sign a
release and covenant not to sue agreement in the form
agreed upon by the parties; provided that this agreement
shall not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a
Team-affiliated physician or any physician retained by the
NBA or Players Association for the medical evaluation
process.
(e) In the event that the Fitness-to-Play Panel determines that the player
is medically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant
to the standard in subsection (d) above: (i) the player will be required to sign
an informed consent and assumption of risk agreement in the form agreed
upon by the parties before he is able to play or practice in the NBA; and
(ii) upon satisfying the prior clause, shall be deemed at that time medically
able and fit to play basketball in the NBA and permitted to do so.
(f) If the Fitness-to-Play Panel does not determine that the player is
medically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant to
the standard in subsection (d) above, the NBA, a Team, or the Players
Association may again refer the player to the Fitness-to-Play Panel beginning
on the later of the first day of the Season that begins immediately following
the date on which the Panel issued its report or nine (9) months after such
date. The party making such referral must have been advised in writing by
a physician that there have been materially changed circumstances since the
Panel issued its report (e.g., medical advances or a material change in the
player's medical condition) such that the Panel should reconsider its
determination. If a player is referred under this subsection (f), the
Fitness-to-Play Panel shall be comprised of the same members that reviewed
and determined the player's initial referral, provided that the physicians on
such panel are available.
(g) Nothing in this Section 11 shall obligate a Team to permit a player
to play or practice for the Team, even if a Fitness-to-Play Panel determines
that the player is medically able to do so. If the Team disagrees with theFitness-to-Play Panel's conclusion and refuses to permit the player to play
and practice with the Team due to the injury, illness, or other medical
condition for which the player was referred to the Fitness-to-Play Panel,
then the Team will be required, within sixty (60) days of the Panel's issuance
of its report (or, if the report is issued during the period from the date that
is sixty (60) days prior to the date of the NBA trade deadline through May
31, then by August 1) (the "Evaluation Period"), to either trade the player,
agree to amend the player's Contract in accordance with Article II,
Section 3(p) of the CBA, waive the player pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the
Uniform Player Contract, or waive the player pursuant to the "Partial Waiver
Procedure" described in Section 11(i) below (a "Partial Waiver"); provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any player who is in the last
year of his Contract (excluding any Option Year) at the time that the Panel
provides its report to the NBA, the player's Team, and the Players
Association pursuant to Section 11(d)(1) above. During the Evaluation
Period, the player, shall cooperate with the Team in connection with the
Team's efforts to evaluate the player's injury, illness, or other medical
condition, including by, among other things, in a prompt and diligent
manner supplying all information requested of him, completing medical
forms, and submitting to all examinations, tests, and workouts requested of
him by or on behalf of the Team.
(h) If a player referred to a Fitness-to-Play Panel satisfies the waiting
period set forth in Article VII, Section 4(h)(1) of the CBA at the time of
such referral (or any time thereafter prior to the Panel issuing its report),
then the Team may request that such Panel, acting by majority vote, also
serve as the physician described in Article VII, Section 4(h)(2) of the CBA,
and accordingly provide in the Panel's report a determination for the
purposes of Article VII, Section 4(h) of the CBA.
(i) In order for an eligible Team, pursuant to Section 11(g) above, to
designate an eligible player's Contract for a Partial Waiver, the Team must
provide written notice of such waiver and designation to the NBA. Once a
Team duly invokes the Partial Waiver Procedure, such procedure shall
operate as follows:
(i) The waiver period shall be the same as the period for other
waivers.(ii) Any Team other than the Team requesting the waiver may
submit either a Full Waiver Claim or a Partial Waiver Claim
for the player. A "Full Waiver Claim" is a claim for the full
value of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to
Section 5 of the NBA By-Laws. A "Partial Waiver Claim" is
a discount bid of a specified dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining
term of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for any
amount equal to or greater than the total of the applicable
Minimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining Protected
Years (as defined below) of the Contract and less than the
total of the full Base Compensation provided for in all of the
Remaining Protected Years of the Contract, provided that a
Partial Waiver Claim may never be less than the total of the
unprotected Base Compensation provided for in all of the
Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. A "Remaining
Protected Year" means any remaining year of the Contract
that contains any amount of Base Compensation protection
that is not contingent on some event occurring on a date
after the request for waivers; any remaining years of the
Contract that are not Remaining Protected Years shall
hereinafter be referred to as "Remaining Unprotected
Years." For clarity, any Player Option Year in which the
Contract includes the language in Article XII, Section
2(a)(A) and the Effective Season of an ETO shall be a
Remaining Protected Year, and any Player Option Year in
which the Contract that includes the language in Article XII,
Section 2(a)(B) and any Team Option Year shall be a
Remaining Unprotected Year.
(iii) In order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must
have a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal to
at least the portion of the Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A)
below) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year
of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "room" includes room
that can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g., via
renouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and suchroom must be created immediately upon the awarding of the
player pursuant to this waiver procedure.
(iv) If at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the
waiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team
submitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the highest
order of preference in accordance with the waiver
procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws.
If no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least one (1)
Partial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract shall be
awarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver
Claim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1) Team submits
the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars, to the Team
submitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars
that is entitled to the highest order of preference in
accordance with the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA
Constitution and By-Laws).
(v) If there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim
submitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the
Contract shall be terminated.
(vi) In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the
"Claiming Team") as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:
(A) The Claiming Team shall be responsible for payment
of the player's Base Compensation in an amount
equal to the total dollar amount of the Partial Waiver
Claim allocated over the Remaining Protected Years
of the Contract in proportion to the Base
Compensation amounts provided for in each
Remaining Protected Year of the Contract (e.g., if the
player has two (2) years remaining on his Contract
with \$10 million of Base Compensation in year one
that is fully protected and \$11 million of Base
Compensation in year two that is fifty percent (50%)
protected and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was
for \$6 million, the Claiming Team shall be
responsible for \$2.86 million of the player's Base
Compensation in year one and \$3.14 million in yeartwo) (the "Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation"). The waiving Team shall be
responsible for paying the total Base Compensation
in each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract
less the Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation for each Remaining Protected Year of
the Contract (the "Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation"). In addition to the
Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation, the
Claiming Team shall also be responsible for the total
amount of all other Compensation obligations
contained in the Contract other than Base
Compensation (including, but not limited to, the full
amount of any Incentive Compensation) and the
total Base Compensation for any Remaining
Unprotected Year.
(B) The Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation
plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to each
Remaining Protected Year of the Contract and the
total Base Compensation plus any Likely Bonuses of
any Remaining Unprotected Year shall be included
in the Team Salary of the Claiming Team
immediately upon the awarding of the player to the
Claiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.
(C) The Claiming Team may not trade a player awarded
as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1
following the award of the player's Contract to the
Claiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.
If a Claiming Team proposes to trade to another
Team a player awarded as a result of a Partial Waiver
Claim (after the waiting period set forth in the
preceding sentence) or if the Claiming Team
subsequently waives the player and another Team
proposes to acquire such player in accordance with
the NBA waiver procedure, then: (i) for purposes of
determining (a) whether the acquiring Team has
Room for the Contract, and (b) in the case of a trade,
the amount of any Traded Player Exception inrespect of such player's Contract, the player's Salary
shall be deemed to equal the Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses
applicable to the then-current Salary Cap Year; and
(ii) the acquiring Team shall thereafter be deemed
the Claiming Team for the purposes of this
Section 11(i).
(D) The Claiming Team shall be responsible for making
all payments to the player (and paying all related
payroll taxes) other than Compensation due with
respect to any Season prior to the waiver. The
waiving Team shall reimburse the Claiming Team
for the portion of the Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation applicable to each pay
period on or before each applicable pay date.
(vii) In the event that the Contract is awarded to the Claiming
Team as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim and the Claiming
Team subsequently waives the player (a "Subsequent
Waiver") resulting in the termination of the Contract:
(A) Without taking into consideration any conditional
Base Compensation protection triggered after the
date of the initial request for waivers but before the
Subsequent Waiver (hereinafter referred to as
"Triggered Base Compensation Protection"), if the
Contract contains full Base Compensation
protection in each of the Remaining Protected Years
or if the Contract contains no Remaining Protected
Years, the Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation and the Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation shall remain unchanged.
(B) Without taking into consideration any Triggered
Base Compensation Protection, if the Contract
contains partial protection in one (1) or more of the
Remaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base
Compensation Obligation and Waiving Team Base
Compensation Obligation for each such year shall beadjusted as follows upon the termination of the
Contract:
(1) The Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation for any Remaining Protected
Year that contains only partial Base
Compensation protection shall be reduced
by a number equal to the Claiming Team
Base Compensation Obligation for that year,
divided by the total Base Compensation
obligation for that year, multiplied by the
unprotected Base Compensation remaining
to be paid that year (the "Adjusted Claiming
Team Base Compensation Obligation").
(2) The Waiving Team Base Compensation
Obligation for any Remaining Protected
Year that contains only partial Base
Compensation protection shall be reduced
by a number equal to the Waiving Team
Base Compensation Obligation for that year,
divided by the total Base Compensation
obligation for that year, multiplied by the
unprotected Base Compensation remaining
to be paid for that year.
(C) The full amount of any Triggered Base
Compensation Protection shall be added to the
Adjusted Claiming Team Base Compensation
Obligation in each remaining year of the Contract
that contains Triggered Base Compensation
Protection.
(j) The costs associated with the Fitness-to-Play Panels will be borne
equally by the NBA and the Players Association, and the Players
Association's share shall be paid by the NBA and included in Player Benefits
under Article IV, Section 6(l) of this Agreement.Section 12. Player Care Survey.
The NBA and the Players Association will jointly conduct a confidential
player survey during the 2023-24 Season (and during one or more
subsequent Seasons during the term of this Agreement as determined by the
parties) to solicit the players' input and opinion regarding the adequacy of
medical care provided by their respective medical and training staffs and
commission independent analyses of the results of such surveys. The costs
of such surveys and analyses will be borne equally by the NBA and the
Players Association, and the Players Association's share shall be paid by the
NBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(l) of this
Agreement.
Section 13. Wearables.
(a) The wearables joint advisory committee formed by the NBA and the
Players Association (the "Wearables Committee") shall continue to review
and approve wearable devices for use by players. "Wearables" shall mean a
device worn by an individual that measures movement information (such as
distance, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, jumps, changes of direction,
and player load calculated from such information and/or height/weight),
physiological information (such as heart rate, heart rate variability, skin
temperature, blood oxygen, hydration, lactate, and/or glucose), or other
health, fitness, and performance information.
(b) The Wearables Committee shall consist of three (3) representatives
appointed by the NBA and three (3) representatives appointed by the
Players Association. At least one of the members appointed by each of the
NBA and the Players Association must have at least three (3) years of
experience in sports medicine (such as a physician, athletic trainer, strength
and conditioning coach, or sports scientist) in the NBA or with an NCAA
Division I collegiate basketball team (or other relevant experience and
expertise as agreed upon by the parties). Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, Committee members may not have an ownership or other financial
interest in any company that produces or sells any wearable device.
(c) The Wearables Committee shall be responsible for: (i) reviewing all
requests by Teams, the NBA, or the NBPA to approve a wearable device
for use by players, with the standard being whether the wearable device
would be potentially harmful to anyone (including the player) if used as
intended, and whether the wearable's functionality has been validated; and(ii) setting cybersecurity standards for the storage of data collected from
Wearables.
(d) The Wearables Committee will jointly retain such experts as it deems
necessary in order to conduct its work (e.g., to validate a wearable device or
to set cybersecurity standards), which the parties expect to include
professionals in areas such as engineering, data science, and cybersecurity.
The costs of such experts will be borne equally by the NBA and the Players
Association, and the Players Association's share shall be paid by the NBA
and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(l) of this
Agreement.
(e) No Team may request a player to use any Wearable unless such
device is one of the devices currently in use as set forth in Section 13(f)
below or the device and the Team's cybersecurity standards have been
approved by the Committee pursuant to Section 13(c) above.
(f) Teams may request that, on a voluntary basis, players use the
following devices: the FirstBeat Sport system; the Catapult Sports
OptimEye, ClearSky, and Vector systems (including with a Polar chest strap
but not with the Catapult heart rate vest); the iMeasureU Step Trident
system; Kinexon Sports systems (including with a Kinexon heart rate vest
paired with a Polar sensor); the ShotTracker system; the Strive Sense3
systems; the WHOOP Performance Strap 2.0; the Zephyr Performance
System; and the Oura Ring (collectively, the "Approved Wearables").
Wearables (whether Approved or otherwise) may not be used in games. Use
of any wearable that is not among the Approved Wearables is prohibited.
In addition: (i) the only metric categories and/or system variables that
Teams can use from Approved Wearables are those that were designated as
"Pass" in the wearables validation reports provided to the parties by their
jointly retained experts; and (ii) Teams must follow the safety directions of
the jointly retained experts as provided to Teams in the Wearable Device
Validation Reports. With respect to raw or unprocessed data exports or
APIs from Approved Wearables ("Raw Data"), so long as such Raw Data
are not provided through a dashboard or other visual within an Approved
Wearable's software platform, the foregoing shall not prohibit Teams from
(i) using Raw Data so long as the Raw Data is used in metric categories
and/or system variables that were designated as "Pass" in the Wearable
Device Validation Reports, or (ii) receiving Raw Data. If upon evaluation
by the Committee, any of the foregoing devices are reviewed and are notapproved by the Committee, Teams will be required to discontinue the use
of such Wearables.
(g) A Team may request a player to use in practice (or otherwise not in
a game) on a voluntary basis a Wearable that has been approved by the
Committee. A player may decline to use (or discontinue use of) a Wearable
at any time. Before a Team could request that a player use an approved
Wearable, the Team shall be required to provide the player a written,
confidential explanation of: (i) what the device will measure; (ii) what each
such measurement means; and (iii) the benefits to the player in obtaining
such data.
(h) A player will have full access to all data collected on him from
approved Wearables. Members of the Team's staff may also have access to
such data but it can be used only for limited purposes as set forth below.
Data collected from a Wearable worn at the request of a Team may be used
for player health and performance purposes and Team on-court tactical and
strategic purposes only. The data may not be considered, used, discussed,
or referenced for any other purpose such as in negotiations regarding a
future Player Contract or other Player Contract transaction (e.g., a trade or
waiver) involving the player. In a proceeding brought by the Players
Association under the procedures set forth in Article XXXI, the Grievance
Arbitrator will have authority to impose a fine of up to \$250,000 on any
Team shown to have violated this provision.
(i) To advance the shared goal of the NBA and the Players Association
to promote player health and reduce injuries, and in light of the preference
of the NBA that game use of Wearables be required, and the preference of
the Players Association that Wearables not be required in games and instead
be allowed to be worn in games on a voluntary basis only in connection with
modified rules regarding commercialization, the NBA and Players
Association will continue to discuss in good faith matters related to the use
of wearable devices. Pending an agreement between the parties, Wearables
may not be used in games, and no player data collected from a Wearable
worn at the request of a Team may be made available to the public in any
way or used for any commercial purpose.Section 14. NBA Draft Combine.
(a) Each year, the NBA shall organize and operate a Draft Combine
prior to the NBA Draft. All players invited by the NBA to attend the Draft
Combine shall be required to attend and participate in the following
components of the Draft Combine ("Combine Components"):
(i) Strength and agility tests, shooting drills, performance
testing, and anthropometric measurements (e.g., height,
wingspan) (five-on-five scrimmages or any other live action
offense versus defense drill (e.g., half-court four-on-four or
two-on-one) shall be optional for all players);
(ii) League-directed: medical history information, medical
testing (e.g., MRIs, echocardiograms, and laboratory tests,
other than tests for controlled substances), medical
examinations, and biomechanical and functional movement
testing, including, for clarity, with respect to any of the
foregoing in this subsection (ii), any medical examination in
accordance with subsection (d) below and/or follow-up in
accordance with subsection (e) below;
(iii) Media circuit;
(iv) Player development sessions;
(v) Team interviews; and
(vi) Other tests and/or assessments.
The NBA shall determine and establish the Combine Components
above, provided that the performance testing contemplated in the
foregoing Component (a)(i), the medical testing contemplated in
the foregoing Component (a)(ii), and the foregoing
Components (a)(iii)-(vi) shall be determined in consultation with
the Players Association.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement to attend and
participate in the Combine Components, any invited player who is physically
unable to participate in one or more basketball activities (as set forth in
subsection (a)(i) above), medical testing or biomechanical or functionalmovement testing (as set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above), or any other tests
or assessments at the Draft Combine (as set forth in subsection (a)(vi)
above) shall be (i) excused from participation in some or all of the applicable
activities or tests at the time of the Draft Combine, (ii) required at the Draft
Combine to complete the Combine Components that he is able to complete,
and (iii) required subsequently to complete, by no later than the eleventh day
before the Draft, the remaining Combine Components, as reasonably
determined by the NBA unless he remains physically unable to do so. Any
determination with respect to this subsection (b) shall be made by the NBA's
medical director for the Draft Combine, who shall be required to consider
any opinion timely provided by the player's treating physician.
(c) The NBA may excuse an invited player from attending one or more
days of the Draft Combine due to a reasonable excuse, as reasonably
determined by the NBA (e.g., family tragedy, birth of a child, playing with a
FIBA club that is still in season at the time of the Draft Combine). Any
such player may be required subsequently to complete, by no later than the
eleventh day before the Draft, Combine Components as reasonably
determined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association (e.g., by
attending an NBA Global Camp or via individual assessments and
examinations arranged by the NBA).
(d) The NBA and Players Association shall agree annually on certain
jointly-selected orthopedic medical specialists with expertise in foot and
ankle, knee, spine, hip, and wrist/hand injuries to attend the Draft Combine,
conduct medical examinations of particular players at the request of either
the player or a Team, and prepare a report for each such player. Subject to
the limits on Teams accessing information on certain players in accordance
with subsection (g) below, as with other medical history information, testing,
and examinations from Combine Components, the NBA shall make any
such report(s) from an orthopedic medical specialist available to the player
and to Teams via the file in respect of the player in the EMR.
(e) Based on available medical information, including the results of
medical testing at the Draft Combine, the NBA may require any player who
was invited to the Combine to undergo, by no later than the eleventh day
before the date of the Draft, reasonable and appropriate follow-up testing
or examination after the Draft Combine, as determined by the NBA's
medical director for the Draft Combine in consultation with the player's
treating physician (if any).(f) A player shall fail to fulfill his obligation to participate in the Draft
Combine in respect of a Draft, and shall therefore be ineligible to be selected
in such Draft in accordance with Article X, Section 9 of the CBA, if he is
invited by the NBA to attend the Draft Combine and, as reasonably
determined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association, fails
to fully participate in the Combine Components in which the player is
required to participate pursuant to subsections (a)-(e) above.
(g) The NBA shall organize and operate an annual process that utilizes
the following method (the "Top-10 Formula") for the purpose of
developing a ranking of the top-10 players eligible in that year's Draft:
i. The NBA (after consultation with the Players Association)
shall annually select no fewer than (a) two (2) publications
with publicly-available pre-Draft rankings and (b) two (2)
individuals with relevant basketball experience (each such
individual, a "Combine Player Ranker") for the purpose of
generating the composite ranking described below.
ii. The NBA shall utilize (a) from each such publication
referenced in subsection (i) above, its publicly-available
pre-Draft rankings, and (b) from each Combine Player
Ranker, his or her ranking of the top-fifteen players eligible
in that year's Draft.
iii. Any player who is ranked within the top-fifteen by one (1)
publication and/or Combine Player Ranker, but not ranked
within the top-fifteen by another publication and/or
Combine Player Ranker shall, for purposes of computing the
ranking of such other publication(s) and/or Combine Player
Ranker(s), be given a ranking of sixteen (16). For clarity,
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, multiple players may be
given such ranking of sixteen (16) for any publication and/or
Combine Player Ranker that does not rank the player within
the top-fifteen (e.g., if two (2) or more players are ranked
within the top-fifteen by one (1) publication and/or
Combine Player Ranker, but not ranked as such by one (1)
or more of the other publication(s) and/or Combine Player
Ranker(s)).iv. A composite ranking shall be determined by taking, for each
player, the median ranking of each such publication's
publicly-available ranking and each such Combine Player
Ranker's individual ranking provided to the NBA (such
median ranking, the "Combine Player Ranking").
v. Each player whose Combine Player Ranking equals one of
the ten (10) lowest numbers (i.e., where 1 is the lowest
possible sum that can be generated via the Top-10 Formula
and thus the highest possible ranking for any player) shall be
considered a top-10 player eligible in that year's Draft. If
two (2) or more players ranked first through tenth have the
same Combine Player Ranking, then the median ranking of
the publicly-available rankings from each publication
referenced in subsection (g)(i) above shall be used to
determine each such player's ranking (e.g., if two (2) players
have the same Combine Player Ranking, and such Ranking
is higher than that of five (5) other players, then the player
with the lower median ranking of each such publication's
publicly-available ranking will be ranked sixth and the player
with the higher median ranking will be ranked seventh). If
still tied, then each such publication's publicly-available
ranking and each Combine Player Ranker's individual
ranking for each such player shall be aggregated, and the
player with the lower total sum will be considered the higher-
ranked player, followed by the player with the higher total
sum. If still tied, the NBA shall conduct a random drawing
to determine each such player's ranking.
vi. If in any particular year covered by this Agreement the NBA
determines that it is impracticable to calculate one or more
of the rankings set forth in subsection (g)(i) above (e.g., due
to the unavailability of a Combine Player Ranker, or if there
are fewer than two (2) publications whose publicly-available
pre-Draft rankings are determined by the NBA (after
consultation with the Players Association) to be suitable for
this purpose), the NBA may, after consultation with the
Players Association, generate an output of the Top-10
Formula using as many of such publication(s)' and/orCombine Player Ranker(s)' individual ranking(s) as is
reasonably practicable.
The NBA shall finalize and provide to the Players Association the
list of players eligible in that year's Draft who are ranked first
through tenth per the Top-10 Formula. The NBA shall finalize such
list during the period beginning with the deadline established by the
NBA under Article X, Section 1(b)(ii)(G) of the CBA to qualify as
an Early Entry player and prior to the earlier of the date on which
(x) the NBA conducts a drawing among the Teams that did not
participate in the playoffs in the Season immediately preceding that
year's NBA Draft to determine the order of selection positions in
such NBA Draft, or (y) the on-site process to gather players' medical
history commences (i.e., the medical intake portion of the medical
history referenced at subsection (a)(ii) above).
The information gathered from such players' Combine Components set
forth in subsection (a)(ii) above (and (a)(vi) above to the extent that any such
test or assessment involves medical information in respect of a player) shall
be made available by the NBA after it is gathered: (1) for the player ranked
first, to Teams selecting first through tenth in that year's Draft; (2) for the
players ranked second through sixth, to Teams selecting first through
fifteenth in that year's Draft; (3) for the players ranked seventh through
tenth, to Teams selecting first through twenty-fifth in that year's Draft; and
(4) for all other players invited to the Draft Combine, all Teams. For clarity,
any assignee Team that trades for a Draft selection position within the top-
25 selection positions in that year's Draft shall subsequently be given access
to the information gathered from the Combine Components set forth in
subsection (a)(ii) above for each player associated with such Draft selection
position. Beginning on the day after the conclusion of the Draft, Teams will
no longer have access to such information for any player whom a Team did
not select in the Draft (or whose Draft rights the Team does not hold).
(h) Nothing in this Section 14 shall limit the right of the NBA, the
Players Association, or a Team to refer a player eligible for a Draft, prior to
that year's Draft, to a Fitness-to-Play Panel, in accordance with Article XXII,
Section 11 of the CBA, if advised by a physician that the player is medically
unable and/or medically unfit to perform his duties as a professional
basketball player as a result of a potentially life-threatening injury, illness, or
other medical condition and/or that performing such duties would likelycreate a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal
injury for the player. In any such case, the fact that the player was referred,
the Panel's determination, and all medical information in the player's
medical file that any member of the Panel deemed relevant to the injury,
illness, or other medical condition for which the player was referred shall be
made available to all Teams following the Panel's determination.
(i) For clarity, nothing in this Section 14 shall be construed to limit in
any way (i) the right of a Team to request that a player eligible for a Draft
voluntarily participate in the administration of such activities described in
subsection (a) above (e.g., in connection with visiting a Team's practice
facility during the period between the Draft Combine and the Draft) or
provide the Team with information, including information from the
Combine Components described in subsection (a)(ii) above, or (ii) the right
of a player to supplement medical information gathered from those
Combine Components set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above with additional
information that the NBA shall make available to all Teams via the EMR,
subject to subsection (g) above.
(j) (i) Teams may use the results of information gathered from
such Combine Components set forth in subsection (a)(ii)
above for Draft evaluation purposes only, and may not
discuss any such results with representatives of any other
Team (regardless of whether the other Team would
otherwise have access to the same results); provided,
however, that (1) medical staff from Teams entitled to access
the player's information in accordance with subsection (g)
above may discuss such results with medical staff of other
Teams who performed the medical examination of the
player at the Draft Combine or in connection with
subsections (b), (c), or (e) above (for clarity, the only Team
personnel who will be involved in such examinations will be
those who are entitled to access the player's information in
accordance with subsection (g) above); (2) a Team may
discuss such results with representatives from other Teams
entitled to access the player's information in accordance with
subsection (g) above if the player provides written consent
(with notice to the Players Association); and (3) nothing in
this Section 14 shall limit any rights a Team has to use or
disclose such results in respect of a player who is undercontract with the Team or as to whom the Team holds
exclusive Draft rights (e.g., following the Draft, a team
disclosure of medical information in connection with a trade
of a player's Draft rights). For clarity, a Team will not have
violated this subsection (j)(i) to the extent its discussion
involves only public information regarding a player.
(ii) If the NBA has reason to believe that the confidentiality
restriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been
violated, it shall advise the Players Association in a timely
manner.
(iii) If the Players Association determines that the confidentiality
restriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been
violated, it may bring a proceeding under Article XXXII,
Section 1 of the CBA before the System Arbitrator. Upon a
finding by the System Arbitrator of a material violation, the
System Arbitrator shall have the authority to impose on any
Team found to have committed such violation a fine of up
to \$1,000,000. In considering appropriate discipline for a
violation, the System Arbitrator shall take into account all
relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of
the violation on the player, the degree of care demonstrated
by the Team, and any ill intent regarding the player.
(k) The NBA will consult with the Players Association in good faith on
(i) creating a list of non-exclusive jointly-recommended interview questions
to provide to Teams each year prior to the Draft Combine, and (ii) any issues
the Players Association raises relating to scheduling or operational details of
the Draft Combine (e.g., setting the dates and location of the Draft Combine,
elements of the player experience at the Draft Combine).
(l) (i) Each player invited to the Draft Combine will be provided
one (1) complimentary first class travel accommodations
(except when such accommodations are not available) for
himself and one family member to the market in which such
Draft Combine is held, and (2) one (1) complimentary
individual room in a group of hotel rooms reserved by the
NBA for the Draft Combine. One certified agent who
represents each such player participating in the Combineshall (x) be permitted to reserve one (1) room in such group
of hotel rooms (at such agent's expense); and (y) receive an
NBA credential at the Draft Combine to attend the on-court
activities set forth in subsection (a)(i) above; provided that if
the Players Association notifies the NBA that a player
participating in the Draft Combine is represented by a
second certified agent who does not already have an NBA
credential to attend the on-court activities set forth in
subsection (a)(i) above, such second agent shall receive such
credential.
(ii) Each player invited to the Draft Combine will be offered an
NBAGL contract covering the season immediately
following the Draft Combine. To benefit players, the NBA
shall also undertake to provide new media opportunities at
the Draft Combine for players who attend and participate in
the Combine Components.
(iii) Mental health and wellness programming, jointly created by
the NBA and Players Association for players, will be
included as part of the Pre-Draft Information Program
presented at the Draft Combine.
