threats of sabotage or terrorism; explosions; epidemics; weather or natural
disasters, including, but not limited to, fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes,
tornados, storms, or earthquakes; and any governmental order or action

events or conditions is within the reasonable control of the NBA or an NBA
Team.
(b) In addition to any other rights a Team or the NBA may have by
contract or by law, if a Force Majeure Event occurs and, as a result, one or
more Teams are unable to play one or more games (whether Exhibition,
Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff games), then, for each missed game
during such period (the "Force Majeure Period") that was not rescheduled
and replayed, the Compensation payable to each player who was on the
roster of a Team that was unable to play one or more games during the
Force Majeure Period shall be reduced by 1/92.6th of the player's

purposes of the foregoing calculation, and notwithstanding the actual
number of games that any Team played, was scheduled to play, or could
have played during the Seasons(s) affected by the Force Majeure Event, each
Team shall be deemed to play five (5) Exhibition games, eighty-two (82)
Regular Season games, and 5.6 playoff games during each such Season.
(c) In the event that Section 5(b) above applies, the applicable
Compensation reduction from each player shall be withheld by the player's
Team from the first Compensation payment (or payments, if the first such
payment is insufficient to satisfy the reduction) that is (or are) due or to
become due to such player following the commencement of the Force
Majeure Period (whether under the Player Contract that was in existence at
the commencement of the Force Majeure Period or any subsequent Player
Contract between the player and the Team). If such Compensation payment
(or payments) is (or are) insufficient to cover the Compensation reduction
required by Section 5(b) above, then either (i) the player shall promptly pay
the difference directly to the Team ("old Team"), or (ii) if he subsequently
enters into a Player Contract with, or is traded to, another NBA Team ("new
Team"), such difference shall be withheld from the first available
Compensation payment (or payments, if the first such payment is
insufficient to satisfy the remaining reduction) that is (or are) due to theplayer from the new Team and shall be remitted by the new Team to the old
Team.
(d) Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event satisfying the terms
of Section 5(a) above, the NBA shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as of the sixtieth (60th) day following delivery to the Players
Association of a written notice of termination, which must be delivered to
the Players Association within sixty (60) days of the Force Majeure Event.

(b) BRI for the Trigger Salary Cap Year is less than ninety-five

are unable to agree to adjustments to this Agreement in accordance with the
foregoing, then the NBA and Players Association will each have the option
to terminate this Agreement effective as of the June 30 of the Salary Cap
Year immediately following the Trigger Salary Cap Year, by serving written
notice of its exercise of such option on the other party on or before the date

entity continues to hold a non-controlling minority ownership interest in
such entity following such sale or transfer, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith such modifications to the CBA as may be appropriate, to take effect
beginning with the Salary Cap Year in which such sale or transfer occurs and
taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances including the
amounts included in BRI prior to such sale or transfer, to ensure a fair
inclusion of amounts in BRI following such sale or transfer. In the event
the parties are unable to reach an agreement on CBA modifications within

period of thirty (30) days elect to terminate the CBA, by written notice to
the other party, effective as of the June 30 immediately following the service
of the termination notice (or, if later, as of the first June 30 that is at least
sixty (60) days following the service of the termination notice). Should

parties agree in a successor Collective Bargaining Agreement.

The grant to either party of a right or option to terminate pursuant to the
provisions of this Article XXXIX shall not carry with it the obligation to
exercise that right or option; and the failure of the NBA or the Players
Association to exercise any right or option to terminate this Agreement with
respect to any playing Season in accordance with this Article XXXIX shall
not be deemed a waiver of or in any way impair or prejudice the NBA or
the Players Association's right or option, if any, to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with this Article XXXIX with respect to any succeeding
Season.
