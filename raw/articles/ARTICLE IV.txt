with and subject to the terms and conditions of the National Basketball
Association Players' Pension Plan, as restated effective July 1, 2017, and as
amended from time to time and as to be modified as set forth herein (the
"Pension Plan"), and the Amended and Restated Agreement of Trust for
the Pension Plan, effective as of July 1, 2017, and as amended from time to

(1) Current Benefit. As of the effective date of this Agreement,
the monthly amount per Year of Credited Service payable as a
Normal Retirement Pension (the "Monthly Benefit") is \$1,001.47.
(2) Benefit Increase.
(i) The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide that,
effective as of February 2, 2024, (A) the Normal Retirement
Date shall be the first of the month following a player's
sixty-second (62nd) birthday, and (B) the Early Retirement

Retirement Pension, as determined using modified actuarial
equivalence factors to be specified in the Pension Plan
amendment effective as of February 2, 2024.(ii) Effective for the Plan Year commencing February 2,
2024, and for each subsequent Plan Year during the term of this

New Monthly Benefit shall equal (A) the maximum annual
dollar amount permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") (and the regulations issued
thereunder), as the Code and regulations are in effect as of the
effective date of this Agreement, as such maximum benefit
amount may be adjusted for future increases in the
cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of
the Code, divided by (B) one hundred twenty (120). The
maximum annual dollar amount permitted under the Code (and
the regulations issued thereunder) for a player's Early
Retirement Pension shall be determined using modified
actuarial equivalence factors to be specified in the Pension Plan
amendment effective as of February 2, 2024.
(iii) Any increase in the Normal Retirement Pension or Early
Retirement Pension payable on or after the date of this
Agreement: (A) shall apply only to those players and
beneficiaries (x) who have not yet received or begun to receive
a benefit under the Pension Plan as of the first day of the month
following the beginning of the Plan Year to which the increase
relates (the "New Benefit Increase Commencement Date") or
(y) who are receiving monthly benefits under the Pension Plan
as of the New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; (B) shall
be effective as of the New Benefit Increase Commencement
Date; (C) shall apply only to any benefit payment(s) to be made
on or after the applicable New Benefit Increase
Commencement Date; and (D) shall not require the
recalculation of any benefit payment(s) made prior to the

(b) Two-Way Players. The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide
that, for each Regular Season during the term of this Agreement, a Two-Way
Player shall be considered to be on a Roster if he is (1) on an Active List,
Inactive List, or Two-Way List of any Team on February 2nd of such
Regular Season (or such other date that the parties may agree to), or (2) onthe Active List of any Team for fifty percent (50%) or more of the total
Regular Season games played by the Team during such Regular Season.
(c) Pre-1965 Players and Pre-1965 Retirees. Effective for the Plan
Year commencing February 2, 2018, and for each subsequent Plan Year
during the term of this Agreement:
(1) Pre-1965 Players shall continue to be entitled to receive the
Normal Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms and
conditions set forth in Article XIV of the Pension Plan.
(2) Pre-1965 Retirees shall continue to be entitled to receive the
Retirement Benefit in the amount and on the terms and conditions
set forth in Article XV of the Pension Plan.
(3) Any benefits that are unable to be paid to Pre-1965 Players or
Pre-1965 Retirees under the Pension Plan because of the benefit
limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code shall be paid to such
Pre-1965 Players and Pre-1965 Retirees pursuant to the National
Basketball Association Excess Benefit Plan for Pre-1965 Players (the
"Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan").
(d) Limitations on Benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary:
(1) Neither: (i) the pension benefits accrued or payable to any
player or beneficiary for a Plan Year nor (ii) the New Monthly
Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit amount
permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder) as
in effect for that Plan Year (as adjusted in accordance with the
actuarial factors specified in the Pension Plan and as in effect on the
date that the benefit accrues or commences (or is paid) or for the
Plan Year for which the New Monthly Benefit is determined), as
such maximum benefit amount may be adjusted for future increases
in the cost-of-living in the manner provided under Section 415(d)(2)
of the Code.
(2) Neither the pension benefits accrued nor payable to any player
or beneficiary for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit
amount permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued
thereunder), as in effect as of the effective date of this Agreement,as adjusted in accordance with the actuarial factors specified in the
Pension Plan, and as may be adjusted for future increases in the
cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of the
Code.
(3) If all or any portion of the actuarially-determined annual
contributions to be made to the Pension Plan would not be fully
deductible under the Code when paid to the Pension Plan, the New
Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount which would result in
all of such contributions being fully-deductible when paid. In the
event that any such contribution or portion thereof is not fully
deductible when paid, the NBA and the Players Association agree to
bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to
be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs of any
such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as
determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially
equal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that such Teams
would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the amount by
which the New Monthly Benefit is reduced pursuant to this
Section 1(d)(3). If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the
Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative
arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create
any right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits
to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.
(e) Administration.
(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(f) of the Pension Trust
Agreement, which are hereby incorporated by reference and
expressly designed to survive the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the Pension Plan shall continue to be jointly operated
and administered by the NBA and the Players Association in
accordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and the provisions of the
Pension Trust Agreement and the Pension Plan.
(2) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:
(i) the Pension Plan shall continue to constitute a
collectively-bargained multiemployer defined benefit pension planthat is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; and (ii) the
Pension Plan's corresponding Trust is exempt from taxation under
the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code.
(3) The daily operations of the Pension Plan shall continue to be
delegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as
selected by the Board of Trustees of the Pension Plan in its sole
discretion.
(f) Contributions/Funding. The NBA and Players Association
acknowledge and agree that the Teams shall continue at all times to
contribute to the Plan at least the amount necessary to meet the Pension
Plan's statutory minimum funding requirements under Section 412,
Section 431, and, if applicable, Section 432 of the Code, or any other
applicable law (the "Minimum Funding Standards") for such Plan Year, as
determined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. For any period during the
term of this Agreement during which a new "funding improvement plan" (a
"FIP") is required to be adopted by the Pension Plan under the Minimum
Funding Standards, the funding benchmark for such FIP shall equal the
funding benchmark required by the Minimum Funding Standards. The
Teams may, in the sole discretion of the NBA, contribute to the Pension
Plan more than the amount necessary to meet the Minimum Funding
Standards; provided, however, that any such additional contribution amount
shall not be greater than the contribution amount determined by the
actuaries of the Pension Plan in accordance with the Pension Plan's
historical scheduled contribution methodology. All contributions shall be
conditioned on their being fully deductible by the Teams when paid.
(g) Players Employed by Toronto.
(1) Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment
Partnership (or any successor thereto) ("Toronto") or by an NBA
Team located in any country other than the United States shall
continue to receive pension benefits of comparable value. Except
as otherwise provided in Section 1(g)(2), players employed by
Toronto ("Toronto Players") shall continue to receive such benefits
by means of the Pension Plan and the Toronto Raptors Players'
Pension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 2019, and as amended
from time to time (the "Toronto Plan"); provided, however, that a
player shall not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate)in the Pension Plan for any period of time during which the player
is both a resident of Canada for income tax purposes and a Toronto
Player (a "Canadian Resident") but shall instead be eligible to receive
a cash payment as described in Section 7 below.
(2) If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan
would, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to
Canadian provincial pension legislation and/or Canadian federal
income tax laws (to the extent that the application of such laws
would result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the
NBA Teams or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto Plan's
failure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the Code or
registered under Canadian provincial pension legislation or
Canadian federal tax laws, then any obligation to establish, maintain,
or make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect of Toronto
Players and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this Agreement or
pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall
terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not
impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this
Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other
provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits
to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of such
termination, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in
good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided
by Toronto to the Toronto Players. Any such alternative
arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax
basis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the
annual accrual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the
Pension Plan and the Toronto Plan. If despite good faith
negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with
respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such
failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning
the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or
(C) to strike.
(3) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1(a) of the Toronto Plan,
which are hereby incorporated by reference and expressly designedto survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the
Toronto Plan shall continue to be jointly operated and administered
by the NBA and Players Association in accordance with Section
302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as
amended, Section 8(1)(b) of the Pension Benefits Act (as defined in
the Toronto Plan), and the provisions of the Toronto Plan.
(4) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:
(i) the Toronto Plan shall continue to constitute a
collectively-bargained single employer defined benefit pension plan
that is sponsored by Toronto and is tax-qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and registered under Section 147.1 of the
Income Tax Act (as defined in the Toronto Plan) and Sections 9 and
12 of the Pension Benefits Act; and (ii) the Toronto Plan's
corresponding trust fund shall continue to be exempt from taxation
under the provisions of Section 149(1)(o) of the Income Tax Act
and Section 501(a) of the Code.
(5) The daily operations of the Toronto Plan shall continue to be
delegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as
selected by the Committee of the Toronto Plan in its sole discretion.
(h) Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to
the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether
final, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any
interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,
application, or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law,
or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations
(whether final, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under
the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any of the amendments or benefit increases to be
provided under the Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 1, would result in
the Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a)
of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above
any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this
Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the
Pension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the
Code (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred inconnection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player
employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of
Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation
to continue to provide for the accrual of additional benefits under the
Pension Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective
bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision
of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision
of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right:
(i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms
concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout;
or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players
Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative
arrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs
of any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined
on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater
than the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the
Pension Plan to fund the benefit described in this Section 1, commencing
on the date of termination. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and
the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative
arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any
right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any
terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to
lockout; or (C) to strike.
(i) Additional Pension Benefits Costs. The NBA Teams shall pay
all costs, including, without limitation, the cost of professional fees (e.g.,
attorneys, accountants, actuaries, and consultants) ("Professional Fees"),
incurred in connection with: (1) the operation and administration of the
Toronto Plan (but excluding the cost of contributions made by Toronto to
the Toronto Plan), and (2) the determination and implementation of any
alternative benefits pursuant to Sections 1(g)(2) and/or 1(h).
(j) Actuarial Determinations. All actuarial determinations that need
to be made in connection with, or under, the Pension Plan, including,
without limitation, those necessary to implement this Section 1 and Section
9 below, shall be made by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. Any such
actuarial determinations shall be binding and conclusive.Section 2. Player 401(k) Benefits.
To the extent permitted by the Code and applicable law, the NBA shall
provide the following 401(k) benefits to NBA players and former NBA
players in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the
National Basketball Association Players' 401(k) Savings Plan as restated
effective November 1, 2014, as amended from time to time and as to be
modified as set forth herein (the "401(k) Plan"). (All capitalized terms used
in this Section 2 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings set forth in the 401(k) Plan and, for purposes of this Section 2, the
term "Compensation" shall have the meaning set forth in the 401(k) Plan
and not Article I or Exhibit A of this Agreement.)
(a) Current Benefits. For each Plan Year commencing during the term
of this Agreement, the 401(k) Plan shall continue to provide for: (1) Salary
Deferral Contributions by players, (2) except as may be limited below,
Matching Contributions by Teams in respect of Salary Deferral
Contributions for a Salary Cap Year, as requested in writing by the Players
Association, and (3) After Tax Contributions by players. The request for
the Matching Contributions by the Players Association for a Season shall be
made in writing prior to the commencement of that Season.
(b) Two-Way Matching Contributions. Effective for all Regular
Seasons during the term of this Agreement, the 401(k) Plan shall be
amended to eliminate the matching contribution formula currently
applicable to Two-Way Players and provide Two-Way Players who are
Eligible Players a Matching Contribution pursuant to the formula set forth
in Section 3.7 of the 401(k) Plan.
(c) Timing of Matching Contributions. Any Matching
Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan in respect of each Season shall
be made no later than thirty (30) days following the completion of the Audit
Report for the Salary Cap Year covering such Season.
(d) Limitations on Benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary:
(1) Matching Contributions, Salary Deferral Contributions, and
After Tax Contributions shall at all times be subject to all applicable
limitations under the Code, including, without limitation, the
maximum limitation on contributions under Code Section 415, themaximum limitation on compensation under Code Section
401(a)(17), and the maximum limitation on 401(k) deferrals under
Code Section 402(g).
(2) The total amount of the Salary Deferral Contributions and
Matching Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan shall be
limited to an amount that, taking into account only Compensation
paid to current players by the Teams, would result in all of such
Salary Deferral Contributions and Matching Contributions being
fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
income tax laws) when paid to the 401(k) Plan. If, for any reason,
all or a portion of the Salary Deferral Contributions and Matching
Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan will not, when paid to
the 401(k) Plan, be fully deductible under the Code, the NBA and
the Players Association agree that the contributions shall be reduced
to result in all such contributions being fully deductible when paid.
(e) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the 401(k) Plan shall
continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis
under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that a player shall not
be eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan for the period of time during
which the player is a Canadian Resident but shall instead be eligible to
receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below. If the NBA and the
Players Association should determine that the 401(k) Plan cannot continue
to be provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian
federal income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain
in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by
Toronto to the Toronto Players. The costs of any such alternative
arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis)
to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost that
Toronto would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with respect to the
Matching Contributions for the Toronto Players. If despite good faith
negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect
to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall
not create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of 401(k) benefits to the
players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
(f) 401(k) Plan Tax-Qualification Status. Notwithstanding anything
else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to the Code,ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether final,
temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any
interpretation, application, or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,
application, or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law,
or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations
(whether final, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under
the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement would result
in the 401(k) Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a)
of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above
any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this
Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the
401(k) Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the
Code (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in
connection with the provision of benefits to their non-player employees or
to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b),
(c), or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain or
make contributions to the 401(k) Plan pursuant to this Agreement or
pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate;
provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally
binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally
binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective
bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right: (i) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of 401(k) benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players Association agree to
bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be
provided by the NBA Teams to the players. Any such alternative
arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis)
to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost
that such Teams would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with respect to
Matching Contributions commencing on the date of termination. If despite
good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree
with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure
to agree shall not create any right: (x) to unilaterally implement during the
term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of 401(k)
benefits to the players; (y) to lockout; or (z) to strike.
(g) Additional 401(k) Benefits Costs. The NBA Teams shall pay all
costs incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the401(k) Plan (and in connection with the determination and implementation
of any alternative arrangement pursuant to Section 2(e) and/or Section 2(f)),
including, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees and the 401(k)
Plan's recordkeeper's fixed fee for recordkeeping and other administrative
services provided to the 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, this Section 2(g) shall not apply to: (1) any costs or fees
attributable to a participant-initiated transaction under the 401(k) Plan; or
(2) any investment fees or expenses charged directly against the return on
any investment options under the 401(k) Plan, which, in each case, shall be
paid by the applicable participant.

Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the NBA shall provide

provide that, for purposes of the HRA, retiree medical, and tuition
reimbursement benefits described in Sections 3(a)(1), 3(a)(5), and
3(a)(6) above, for each Regular Season during the term of this
Agreement, a Two-Way Player shall earn a Year of NBA Service if
he is (i) on an Active List, Inactive List, or Two-Way List of any
Team on February 2nd of such Regular Season (or such other date
that the parties may agree to), or (ii) on the Active List of any Team
for fifty percent (50%) or more of the total Regular Season games
played by the Team during such Regular Season.
(b) Administration.
(1) The Health and Welfare Benefit Trust shall continue to be
jointly operated and administered by the NBA and Players
Association in accordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor
Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and the provisionsof the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust Agreement and the Health
and Welfare Benefit Plan, as to be amended pursuant to this
Agreement. It is intended by the NBA and Players Association that
the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan and Health and Welfare Benefit
Trust shall continue to constitute a collectively-bargained voluntary
employees' beneficiary association that qualifies as a tax exempt
organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
(2) The Health and Welfare Benefit Trust Agreement shall
continue to provide that the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and
Health and Welfare Benefit Plan will be administered by the Health
and Welfare Trustees. The daily operations of the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan and each of the benefits provided thereunder
shall continue to be delegated to one or more independent
third-party administrators and/or insurers, as applicable.
(3) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 3(b) shall
prevent the Education Trust (defined below) from engaging or
hiring an academic advisor or career counselor to assist with player
outreach and similar functions with respect to the tuition
reimbursement and career transition program set forth in
Section 3(a)(6).
(c) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto
Players on the same basis as players who are not Toronto Players; provided,
however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the HRA Benefit
for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but
shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7
below. If the NBA and the Players Association determine that the Health
and Welfare Benefit Plan cannot provide one or more of the benefits
described in Section 3(a) to Toronto Players (1) that are substantially
equivalent to the benefits provided to players employed by Teams located
in the United States or (2) on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal
income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good
faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto
to the Toronto Players. The annual cost incurred by the Teams in
connection with any such alternative arrangement (as determined on an
after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have
incurred to fund the applicable benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) for suchToronto Player. The cost to Toronto of funding any alternative
arrangement(s) to any of the benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith
negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect
to any alternative arrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree
shall not create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of
this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or
to be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan; (B) to lockout; or
(C) to strike.
(d) Deductibility of Contributions/Regulatory Changes.
(1) The Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan shall be operated and administered in a manner
that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully
deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income
tax laws) when paid to the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust (or
directly to an insurance carrier for a benefit provided under the
Health and Welfare Benefit Plan). If any Team is disallowed a
deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and unless
the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to provide the benefit
(or portion of the benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan
to which the contribution relates) and to make further contributions
to provide the benefit (or portion of the benefit under the Health
and Welfare Benefit Plan to which the contribution relates) shall
immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3) shall
apply.
(2) In the event that any benefit under the Health and Welfare
Benefit Plan is no longer permissible or available due to applicable
laws (a "Regulatory Change"), the obligation to provide the benefit
shall immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3)
shall apply.
(3) Any termination of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan or a
benefit under such plan pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) shall not
impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this
Agreement, or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other
provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
create any right (i) to unilaterally implement, during the term of thisAgreement, any terms concerning the provision of the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan (or the applicable benefit provided or to be
provided); (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of any
termination pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) of the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan or a benefit under such plan, the NBA and
Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to
alternative arrangement(s) to be provided by the NBA Teams to the
players; provided, however, that any such alternative arrangement(s)
shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to an
alternative arrangement to the Retiree Medical Plan, the terms and
conditions set forth in Section 3(a)(5). The annual cost incurred by
the NBA Teams in connection with any such alternative
arrangement(s) (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed
the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred in providing
the relevant benefit(s) under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan
commencing on the date of termination. Any such alternative
arrangement(s) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and
the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan, be funded by such monies as
may then remain in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and, if the
monies remaining in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust may not
lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such
alternative arrangement(s) shall be funded by the NBA Teams. Any
such alternative arrangement(s) shall be operated and administered
in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being
fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
income tax laws) when paid. The costs of funding any alternative
arrangement(s) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the
Players Association fail to agree with respect to any alternative
arrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree shall not
create any right: (A) to unilaterally implement, during the term of
this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits
provided or to be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan;
(B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.
(e) Additional Health and Welfare Benefits Costs. Except as
otherwise set forth in Section 9(b)(12), the NBA Teams shall pay all costs,
including, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees, incurred in
connection with (1) the operation and administration of the Health andWelfare Benefit Plan Trust and the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan
(including, without limitation, the operation and administration of the
benefits set forth in Section 3(a) above and any other benefits to be provided
under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan), and (2) the determination and
implementation of any alternative arrangement pursuant to Section 3(d)(3).
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Section 3(e) shall not apply to
any costs or fees attributable to investment management fees in connection
with the investment of Health and Welfare Benefit Trust assets. Such costs
and fees shall: (i) be paid out of the assets of the Health and Welfare Benefit
Trust; and (ii) be excluded for purposes of all calculations called for under
this Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation, for
purposes of: (A) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or
Interim Designated Share Audit Report; and (B) calculating Total Benefits,
Total Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits).
Section 4. The Post-Career Income Plan.
To the extent permitted by the Code and applicable law, the NBA shall
provide the following post-career income benefits to NBA players and
former NBA players in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the National Basketball Association Players' Qualified
Post-Career Income Plan, as restated effective July 1, 2017, and as amended
from time to time (the "Qualified Plan") and the National Basketball
Association Players' Non-Qualified Post-Career Income Plan, as restated
effective July 1, 2017, and as amended from time to time (the
"Non-Qualified Plan," and, when referenced collectively with the Qualified
Plan, the "Post-Career Income Plan"). (All capitalized terms used in this
Section 4 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
set forth in the Post-Career Income Plan.)
(a) Current Benefits.
(1) Effective for the Contribution Year (defined below)
commencing November 1, 2023, and for each subsequent
Contribution Year during the term of this Agreement, the
Post-Career Income Plan shall provide for: (i) a Team contribution
to the Post-Career Income Plan for Eligible Players to be used to
purchase Post-Career Annuities (the "Team Contribution"); and
(ii) elective Player Contributions made by Qualifying Players to the
Non-Qualified Plan to be used to purchase Post-Career Annuitieson such players' behalf. The Team Contribution for each Eligible
Player for each Contribution Year shall equal (A) the Additional
Benefit Amount (defined below) divided by the total number of
Eligible Players for such Contribution Year (including, for this
purpose only, any Canadian Resident who but for the fact that he is
a Canadian Resident would otherwise be an Eligible Player) (such
quotient, an Eligible Player's "Allocated Share"), less (B) tax
withholding (solely with respect to contributions made to the
Non-Qualified Plan) in the manner described in Section 3.3 of the
Non-Qualified Plan ("Tax Withholding"). For each Contribution
Year, a portion of a player's Allocated Share shall be contributed to
the Qualified Plan on behalf of such player pursuant to the terms
and conditions described in the Qualified Plan, and a portion to the
Non-Qualified Plan pursuant to the terms and conditions described
in the Non-Qualified Plan. For purposes of this Section 4, a
"Contribution Year" means each November 1 through October 31
in respect of which a Team Funding Pool (defined below) is
provided under this Section 4.
(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4(a) to the contrary,
and subject to the requirements of the Code and IRS rules and
regulations, if the Board of Trustees of the Post-Career Income Plan
(the "PCIP Trustees") determines, after Post-Career Annuities have
been purchased for Eligible Players for a Contribution Year, that a
present or former player should have received an Allocated Share
for such Contribution Year but did not receive an Allocated Share,
such present or former player shall be entitled to an Allocated Share
equal to the amount of the Allocated Share made to the other
Eligible Players for such Contribution Year, which shall be used to
purchase one or more Post-Career Annuities in the same manner
and on the same terms as the other Eligible Players for such
Contribution Year. Unless practicable and otherwise agreed to by
the PCIP Trustees, the cost of such Allocated Share shall not require
a retroactive reduction in the Allocated Share and Post-Career
Annuities of the other Eligible Players for such Contribution Year
but rather shall be paid from the Additional Benefit Amount for the
next Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the
next Season is insufficient, future Seasons). In addition, the cost of
any additional fees or expenses charged by the Insurer for the
purchase of such Post-Career Annuity (or for the purchase of anyother Post-Career Annuity(ies) under the Post-Career Income Plan
on a retroactive basis) shall also be paid from the Additional Benefit
Amount for the next Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit
Amount for the next Season is insufficient, future Seasons).
(b) Deductibility of Team Contributions/Regulatory Changes.
(1) The Post-Career Income Plan shall be structured and
maintained in a manner that will result in the Team Funding Pool
being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable,
Canadian laws) when used toward Team Contributions contributed
to the Post-Career Income Plan. In the event that a Team is
disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for its portion of the
Team Funding Pool, then the Team shall be returned such
disallowed deduction from the Post-Career Income Plan; provided,
however, that, if such portion may not be returned to the Team
under the terms of the Plan or the applicable Group Annuity
Contract or applicable law, then such Team shall instead be
reimbursed for the lost tax benefit resulting from the disallowance
of the deduction from the Additional Benefit Amount for the next
Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next
Season is insufficient, future Seasons) following the date such Team
submits satisfactory documentation of the disallowance to the PCIP
Trustees.
(2) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, if any event
or occurrence, including, without limitation, (i) any change or
amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or
to any regulations (whether final, temporary, or proposed
regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder, (ii) any
interpretation, application, or enforcement (or any proposed
interpretation, application, or enforcement), by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA,
or other applicable law, or any regulations or rulings issued
thereunder, (iii) any regulations (whether final, temporary, or
proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued by the
IRS under the Code or ERISA or (iv) any provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of this
Section 4(b), would result in the Teams being disallowed a deduction
(in whole or in part) for contributions made to the Post-CareerIncome Plan, then any obligation to maintain the Post-Career
Income Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the
NBA, terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall
not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this
Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other
provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment
benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.
(3) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, if any event
or occurrence, including, without limitation, (i) any change or
amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, to
any regulations (whether final, temporary, or proposed regulations),
or rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder, (ii) any
interpretation, application, or enforcement (or any proposed
interpretation, application, or enforcement), by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA,
or other applicable law, or any regulations or rulings issued
thereunder, (iii) any regulations (whether final, temporary, or
proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued by the
IRS under the Code or ERISA or (iv) any provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of this
Section 4, would result in the Qualified Plan no longer being a
tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or would require
NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be
incurred to implement the Qualified Plan in order to maintain its
tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code (but only to the
extent that such additional costs are incurred in connection with the
provision of benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player
employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c),
or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain
and/or make contributions in respect of the Qualified Plan pursuant
to this Agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of
any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor
shall it create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term
of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision ofpost-employment benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to
strike.
(4) If the Taxable Allocated Share attributable to Eligible Players
would be subject to a federal income tax rate higher than the rate
that would apply if the Taxable Allocated Share were paid as Base
Compensation, then any obligation to maintain the Post-Career
Income Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the
Players Association, terminate; provided, however, that any such
termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of
any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor
shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term
of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of
post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to
strike.
(5) In the event of a termination described in Sections 4(b)(2)-(4),
the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with
respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the NBA
Teams to the players. The annual cost to the Teams of any such
alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall
be substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost that such
Teams would have incurred under the Post-Career Income Plan on
the date of termination. The cost of funding of any such alternative
arrangement shall be as set forth in Section 4(d)(1). If despite good
faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree
with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such
failure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally implement
during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout;
or (iii) to strike.
(c) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the Post-Career
Income Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a
tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that
a player shall not be eligible to participate in the Post-Career Income Plan
for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but
shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7
below. If the NBA and the Players Association should determine that thePost-Career Income Plan cannot continue to be provided to Toronto
Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal income tax laws or
that either the Qualified Plan or the Non-Qualified Plan would become
subject to Ontario's Pension Benefits Act, the NBA and Players Association
agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to
be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. The cost of any such
alternative arrangement to be provided in any Contribution Year shall come
from such year's Team Funding Pool and shall equal an Eligible Player's
Allocated Share for such Contribution Year as reduced by all federal, state,
local, payroll, or other tax obligations of any kind (including, where
applicable, Canadian tax) applicable to such player as Toronto, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems necessary. If despite good faith
negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect
to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall
not create any right (1) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment
benefits to the players; (2) to lockout; or (3) to strike.
(d) Funding.
(1) For each Season, except as provided below, one percent (1%)
of BRI for such Season (the "Additional Benefit Amount") shall be
used to fund the Team Funding Pool (or the alternative arrangement
referenced in Sections 4(b)(5) and 4(c)); provided, however, that the
Additional Benefit Amount for a Season shall be subject to
reduction or elimination pursuant to Article VII, Section 12(b)(1).
In no event shall the Additional Benefit Amount be used for any
purpose other than as set forth in the immediately foregoing
sentence. For purposes of all calculations called for under this
Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation,
for purposes of (i) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit
Report, or Interim Designated Share Audit Report, and
(ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries and Benefits, and
Projected Benefits), the amount to be included with respect to the
Additional Benefit Amount shall be the full Additional Benefit
Amount specified in this Section 4(d) and not the reduced
Additional Benefit Amount provided for under Article VII,
Section 12(b)(1).(2) For each Contribution Year, all or a portion of the Additional
Benefit Amount as determined under Section 4(d)(1) (the "Team
Funding Pool") shall be used to fund the Post-Career Income Plan.
(3) The Teams shall contribute the Team Funding Pool, less Tax
Withholding, into the Post-Career Income Plan each November
following the Contribution Year to which it relates or, if later, within
one hundred and twenty (120) days following the completion of the
Audit Report covering the November 1 of such Contribution Year.
(4) For each Salary Cap Year in which the amortized portion of the
amount to be included in BRI from applicable equity securities,
pursuant to Article VII, Section 1(a)(13), exceeds \$5 million,
the NBA and the Players Association shall meet and confer to
discuss in good faith the possibility of creating a funding pool equal
to 50% of such amortized portion (the "Equity Proceeds Funding
Pool") to fund after-tax contributions to the Non-Qualified Plan for
players who were Eligible Players in any of the years during the
period beginning with the Salary Cap Year in which the equity
securities were received and continuing through the first Salary Cap
Year in respect of which contributions to the Non-Qualified Plan
are made in respect of such equity. For clarity, in the event that the
NBA and the Players Association agree to provide the
above-described after-tax benefits, then, for purposes of all
calculations called for under this Agreement of, or relating to,
Benefits (including, without limitation, for purposes of: (i) preparing
the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or Interim Designated
Share Audit Report; and (ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries
and Benefits, and Projected Benefits), the amount to be
included with respect to the benefits shall be the amount of
the Equity Proceeds Funding Pool and not the amount of the
aggregate after-tax amounts contributed to the Non-Qualified Plan.
(e) Additional Post-Career Income Benefits Costs. The NBA
Teams shall pay all costs, including, without limitation, the cost of
Professional Fees and other administrative services provided to the
Post-Career Income Plan (but excluding the cost of contributions made to
the Post-Career Income Plan) in connection with the operation and
administration of the Post-Career Income Plan (or any alternative
arrangement pursuant to Sections 4(b)(5) and (c)).Section 5. Labor-Management Cooperation and Education Trust.
(a) Except as set forth below in this Section 5, as of the effective date
of this Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the National Basketball Players Association/National
Basketball Association Labor-Management Cooperation and Education
Trust (the "Education Trust") shall continue to be jointly operated and
administered by the NBA and the Players Association in accordance with
the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust Establishing the
National Basketball Players Association/National Basketball Association
Labor-Management Cooperation and Education Trust, as restated effective
December 1, 2014, and as amended from time to time (the "Education Trust
Agreement"). It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that,
at all times, the Education Trust shall comply with the provisions of Section
302(c)(9) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and
shall qualify as an exempt organization under the provisions of
Sections 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(3) of the Code.
(b) The Education Trust shall continue to be operated and administered
for the purpose of establishing and providing (1) health education programs,
and (2) education, career transition, and career counseling programs
designed to assist the NBA, NBA Teams, and NBA players in solving
problems of mutual concern not susceptible to resolution within the
collective bargaining process and to enhance the involvement of NBA
players in making decisions that affect their working lives. The NBA and
the Players Association agree to provide jointly-run financial education
programming, which shall be operated and administered by the Education
Trust, subject to the programming being structured to qualify as a permitted
activity of an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5)
of the Code. In the event that a jointly-run financial education program
cannot be structured to qualify as a permitted activity of an exempt
organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5) of the Code, the
NBA and Players Association agree to meet and confer regarding the
establishment of such program through a different vehicle than the
Education Trust.
(c) Alongside jointly-run financial education programs, the NBA and
the Players Association shall each develop and implement such independent
financial education programs as it deems appropriate to be offered on a
voluntary basis in such forms and at such times as deemed appropriate by
the NBA and the Players Association, respectively. The NBA and thePlayers Association agree to confer periodically to share details and thoughts
on best practices with respect to such programs. The NBA and the Players
Association shall be responsible for the costs of their respective independent
programs and such costs shall be excluded for purposes of all calculations
called for under this Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including,
without limitation, for purposes of (1) preparing the Audit Report, Interim
Audit Report, or Interim Designated Share Audit Report, and (2) calculating
Total Benefits, Total Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits).
(d) The NBA and Players Association agree that, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 5:
(1) The amount to be paid by the Teams to fund the education and
career counseling programs to be operated and administered by the
Education Trust for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year shall be no greater
than \$2,020,339;
(2) The amount to be paid by the Teams to fund the career
transition program to be operated and administered by the
Education Trust for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year shall be no greater
than \$893,397;
(3) The amount to be paid by the Teams to fund the health
education programs (or any programs that, pursuant to Section 5(g)
below, are substituted for the health education programs) to be
operated and administered by the Education Trust for the 2023-24
Salary Cap Year shall be no greater than \$628,549;
(4) The maximum funding amount for each of the programs
described in Sections 5(d)(1)-(3) above shall be increased by five
percent (5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year during the term
of this Agreement after the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year;
(5) For each Salary Cap Year, the amount to be paid by the Teams
to fund the jointly-run financial education programs to be operated
and administered by the Education Trust, if any, shall be mutually
agreed upon by the parties; and
(6) Payment of the amount necessary to fund the Education Trust
in respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30)days following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary
Cap Year.
(e) The Education Trust shall be operated and administered in a manner
that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under
the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid. If
any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such
contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to
maintain the Education Trust and to make further contributions to the
Education Trust shall immediately terminate; provided, however, that any
such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other
provision of this Agreement, and shall not create any right (1) to unilaterally
implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the
provision of education programs provided or to be provided by the
Education Trust; (2) to lockout; or (3) to strike.
(f) In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 5(e) above, the
NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to
an alternative arrangement designed to provide the programs described in
the Education Trust Agreement. Such alternative arrangement shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then
remain in the Education Trust and, if the monies remaining in the Education
Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose,
such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the NBA Teams; provided,
however, that the annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection with
such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not
exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to fund the
Education Trust commencing on the date of termination. Any such
alternative arrangement shall be operated and administered in a manner that
will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the
Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid; and, if
funded by the Teams (and not out of existing monies remaining in the
Education Trust), the costs of funding any alternative to the Education
Trust shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If
despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to
agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such
failure to agree shall not create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during
the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of programs
provided or to be provided by the Education Trust; (2) to lockout; or (3) to
strike.(g) Upon written notice delivered to the NBA at least six (6) months
prior to the commencement of any Salary Cap Year, the Players Association
may elect to terminate the programs currently provided by the Education
Trust and substitute alternative programs; provided, however, that the NBA
consents to such substitution, which such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and provided, further, that any new programs shall comply with
the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of the Labor Management Relations Act
of 1947, as amended, and shall qualify as a permitted activity of an exempt
organization under Section 501(c)(5) of the Code.
Section 6. Additional Player Benefits.
Except as set forth below, the NBA shall provide the following additional
benefits:
(a) Workers' compensation benefits in accordance with applicable
statutes. Such benefits will be provided for players and Two-Way Players.
(b) Funding for the annual Players Association High School Basketball
Camp (or any substitute program mutually agreed upon by the parties) in
the amount of \$1,595,792 for the 2023-24 Season, increasing by seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) per Season thereafter for the term of this
Agreement.
(c) A Player Playoff Pool for each Salary Cap Year in an amount equal
to the greater of: (i) \$31,014,350 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is BRI for the Salary Cap Year immediately preceding the
then-current Salary Cap Year and the denominator of which is BRI for the
2021-22 Salary Cap Year, and (ii) the amount of the Player Playoff Pool for
the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.
(1) If, for a Salary Cap Year, the NBA increases the number of
Teams participating in the playoffs above sixteen (16), then the
Player Playoff Pool shall be calculated pursuant to Section 6(c)
above and then increased by \$615,000 for each Team added above
sixteen (16) Teams.
(2) Each year, the NBA will consult with the Players Association
with respect to the method of allocation of the Player Playoff Pool.(3) The players on a Team that receive amounts from the Player
Playoff Pool in respect of a Salary Cap Year shall not be permitted
to share with Team personnel amounts that, in the aggregate, exceed
five percent (5%) of the total amount received by the players on that
Team, collectively, from the Player Playoff Pool in respect of such
Salary Cap Year.
(d) An In-Season Tournament Prize Pool for each Salary Cap Year in
an amount equal to the total prize amounts paid to players in accordance
with the following.
(1) For each Salary Cap Year, the prize amounts paid to players
shall be as follows:
(i) For the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year: (A) \$500,000 to each
"IST Player" (defined below) on the Team that wins the IST
Finals Game; (B) \$200,000 to each IST Player on the Team that
loses the IST Finals Game; (C) \$100,000 to each IST Player on
a Team that loses an IST Semifinals game; and (D) \$50,000 to
each IST Player on a Team that loses an IST Quarterfinals
game; and
(ii) For each subsequent Salary Cap Year: (A) for each IST
Player on the Team that wins the IST Finals Game, an amount
equal to \$500,000 multiplied by the "BRI Growth Factor"
(defined below) for such Salary Cap Year; (B) for each IST
Player on the Team that loses the IST Finals Game, an amount
equal to \$200,000 multiplied by the BRI Growth Factor for
such Salary Cap Year; (C) for each IST Player on a Team that
loses an IST Semifinals game, \$100,000 multiplied by the BRI
Growth Factor for such Salary Cap Year; and (D) for each IST
Player on a Team that loses an IST Quarterfinals game, \$50,000
multiplied by the BRI Growth Factor for such Salary Cap Year;
provided, however, that for each IST Player, the applicable amount
set forth in Section 6(d)(1)(i) or (ii) above shall be multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of knockout stage
games (i.e., IST Quarterfinals games, IST Semifinals games, and the
IST Finals Game) for which the player was on the Team's Active or
Inactive List and the denominator of which is the total number ofknockout stage games played by the Team. For the purposes of the
calculation described in this Section 6(d)(1), a knockout stage game
for which an IST Player was on a Team's Active or Inactive List
while under a Two-Way Contract or a 10-Day Contract shall count
as one-half of a knockout stage game for which such player was on
the Team's Active or Inactive List. For example, if a Two-Way
Player is on the Active or Inactive List of the Team that wins the
In-Season Tournament for all four (4) of the Team's knockout stage
games during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, then such player will
receive a prize amount equal to \$250,000 (i.e., \$500,000 (i.e., the
amount set forth in Section 6(d)(1)(i)(A) above) multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is two (2) (i.e., one-half of a
knockout stage game for each knockout stage game for which the
Two-Way Player was on the Team's Active or Inactive List), and the
denominator of which is four (4) (i.e., the total number of knockout
stage games played by the Team)).
(2) For purposes of this Section 6(d), for each Salary Cap Year:
(i) An "IST Player" is a player who is on a Team's Active or
Inactive List for at least one (1) In-Season Tournament
knockout stage game during such Salary Cap Year.
(ii) The BRI Growth Factor for a Salary Cap Year is a
fraction, the numerator of which is BRI for the immediately
preceding Salary Cap Year and the denominator of which is
BRI for the 2022-23 Salary Cap Year; provided, however, that
the NBA and Players Association may agree to reduce the BRI
Growth Factor for one (1) or more Salary Cap Years to a
smaller fraction with value of no less than one (1).
(e) The employer's portion of payroll taxes.
(f) The Players Association's one-half share of the payment of fees and
expenses to the Accountants (as defined in Article VII, Section 10(a) below)
in connection with any audit conducted under this Agreement, and the
Players Association's one-half share of the payment of fees and expenses
payable with respect to the TV Expert (as defined in Article VII,
Section 1(a)(7)(ii) below) and any expert selected in accordance with
Article VII, Section 1(a)(7)(i).(g) The Players Association's share of the costs of the Anti-Drug
Program as provided for by Article XXXIII.
(h) The sum of the Compensation paid to each player with three (3) or
more Years of Service who signs a one-year, 10-Day, or Rest-of-Season
Contract for the Minimum Player Salary during a Season, less, for each such
player, the Minimum Player Salary for a player with two (2) Years of
Service. The Compensation paid to any such player shall be paid by the
player's Team pursuant to the terms of such player's Uniform Player
Contract, and then reimbursed to the Team out of a League-wide fund
created and maintained by the NBA. Such reimbursement shall be made at
the conclusion of the Season covered by the Contract.
(i) One-half of the annual funding of \$1.5 million for the NBA Players
Legacy Fund that is provided jointly by the NBA and the Players
Association.

Pension Plan because of any new law, change, or amendment made to
ERISA, the Code, and/or any other applicable law or to any regulations
(whether final, temporary, or proposed), rulings or formal guidance issued
thereunder that is effective for a Plan Year that first begins after the effective
date of this Agreement.
(k) Costs of player attendance at the partner forums as set forth in the
following sentence. For the purposes of enhancing career exposure and
professional development, the NBA agrees to permit current and former
players to attend partner forums held from time-to-time with NBA business
partners, subject to advance notice by the players and there being a
reasonable number of player attendees such that the primary purpose of the
forums (i.e., to facilitate interaction between the NBA and business partners)
will be maintained. To the extent reasonably practicable, the NBA agrees to
provide the Players Association with advance notice of partner forums that
it is aware of.
(l) The Players Association's one-half share of the costs of: (1) the
Fitness-to-Play Panels as provided for by Article XXII, Section 11; (2) the

amount equal to \$40,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year and the

of the "Applicable Portion" (as defined below) for all Two-Way
Players. The Applicable Portion for each such player shall be
calculated by multiplying: (A) the total monthly premium payment
for a Two-Way Player who elected that coverage level under the
relevant Two-Way Players' insurance policy that Season; by (B) a

payment contributed by an NBAGL player for the same coverage
level under the corresponding insurance policy covering NBAGL
players during the NBAGL regular season occurring within the
Salary Cap Year immediately preceding that Season, and the
denominator of which is the total monthly premium payment for
that NBAGL player for the same coverage level under the
corresponding insurance policy covering NBAGL players during the
NBAGL regular season occurring within the Salary Cap Year
immediately preceding that Season; and
(8) The portion of the premium costs paid to the applicable
insurer(s) to provide the life and accidental death and

Cap Year; provided, however, that the foregoing amount shall be
decreased by thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) for any
Salary Cap Year following the Players Association's exercise of the
PA Third Two-Way Option set forth in Article XXIX, Section 5(b);
and
(11) Fifty percent (50%) of the cost of Professional Fees that were

date of this Agreement by the Pension Plan's and the Toronto Plan's
third-party administrator in connection with the administration of
the Pension Plan and the Toronto Plan; and
(12) Fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the cost of Professional
Fees that were approved by both an NBA designee and a Players

to \$5,250,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Salary
Cap for such Salary Cap Year, and the denominator of which is the Salary
Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year; provided, however, that the foregoing
amount shall be decreased by thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%)

List shall be reduced by the amount of the portion of the Benefit
Exclusion Amount for the prior Salary Cap Year(s) that is
attributable to such player.
(e) If the NBA and Players Association provide an alternative
arrangement to any benefit referenced in Sections 9(b)(1) through 9(b)(8)
above, the amount to be included in the calculation of the Benefit Exclusion
Amount with regard to that alternative arrangement shall not exceed the
