photograph and media sessions, and submit to a physical examination.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 1(a) above, if a Veteran Player is under
contract to a Team that is scheduled during a particular NBA Season to
participate outside North America in one (1) or more Exhibition or Regular
Season games during the first ten (10) days of the Regular Season (each such
Team, a "Global Games Team"), such Veteran Player may be required to

any such game is scheduled to be held in Africa, Asia, or the Oceania region,
the twenty-eighth day prior to the first game of the Regular Season. If a
Global Games Team requires a Veteran Player to attend training camp
earlier than the twenty-fifth day prior to the first game of the Regular Season
in accordance with the foregoing, then, beginning on the day immediately
following the date on which the Global Games Team lands at its destination
airport in North America after the game(s) outside North America, such
Veteran Player shall be provided one (1) Day Off for each day earlier than
the twenty-fifth day prior to the first game of the Regular Season that such
Global Games Team required the Player to attend training camp.
(c) "First-Year Players" (defined below) may be required to attend
training camp on a date earlier than the date(s) specified in Sections 1(a) and
1(b) above, but no earlier than ten (10) days prior to the date that Veterans
on such Team are required to attend. If a Global Games Team requires
Veteran Players under contract to the Team to attend training camp earlier
than the twenty-fifth day prior to the first game of the Regular Season
pursuant to Section 1(b) above, and further requires First-Year Players toattend training camp on a date that is ten (10) days prior to the date that
Veterans on such Team are required to attend, then, beginning on the day
immediately following the date on which the Global Games Team lands at
its destination airport in North America after the game(s) outside North
America, each such First-Year Player shall be provided one (1) Day Off for
each day earlier than the thirty-fifth day prior to the first game of the Regular
Season that such Global Games Team required the First-Year Player to

of its intention to conduct a team training camp outside the
United States and Canada. Within three (3) business days of
its receipt of such notification, the Players Association shall

disapproval may be based solely on a reasonable and
well-founded concern that the location of such training
camp would be unsafe for players.
(iii) No Team shall hold its training camp outside the United
States and Canada in any two (2) successive Seasons, it being
understood that limited practice sessions held in connection
with one (1) or more exhibition games outside of the United
States or Canada shall not be considered training camp for
the purposes of this Section 1(d)(iii).
(iv) Players on a Team that holds its training camp outside of the
United States and Canada shall have at least one (1) day off
following the travel day during which they travel back to the
United States or Canada from such training camp.For purposes of this Section 1(d), the U.S. Territories and
Caribbean islands shall not be considered "outside the United
States and Canada."
(e) (i) During any six (6) days beginning on the day after the first
day of training camp and ending on the fourteenth (14th)
day of training camp (the "Two-a-Day Period"): (A) a Team
shall be permitted to conduct no more than two (2) regular
practice sessions per day; (B) such session(s) may last an
aggregate of no longer than 3.5 hours (excluding time – not
to exceed 30 minutes – spent stretching and participating in
aerobic warm-ups and cool-downs); (C) there must be at
least a two (2) hour interval between the two (2) practice
sessions; and (D) if a Team elects to conduct two (2) regular
practice sessions during a day, one (1) of the two (2) sessions
must be limited to non-contact activities. For the remainder

more than one (1) regular practice session per day and such
session may last no longer than 3.5 hours (excluding time –
not to exceed 30 minutes – spent stretching and participating
in aerobic warm-ups and cool-downs); provided, however,
that any Team that is unable due to international travel for
pre-season events to conduct two (2) practice sessions per
day during the Two-a-Day Period may make up any missed
practice sessions (up to a maximum of two (2)) during the
first five (5) days upon the Team's return from such
international travel.
(ii) If a Team conducts one (1) or two (2) regular practice
sessions during a day in accordance with Section 1(e)(i)
above, then except as provided in clause (A) of
Section 1(e)(iii) below, the Team shall not, at a separate time
during the day, conduct, organize or supervise any additional
basketball activity on the basketball court.
(iii) Nothing in Sections 1(e)(i) and (ii) above shall be construed
to prohibit a Team, on any day of training camp, from

accordance with Section 1(e)(i) above, plus:(A) on-court skills development sessions (e.g.,
pick-and-roll situations, shooting, passing, etc.) not

defenses; and
(B) team-related or training-related activities (including,
but not limited to, weight training, other
conditioning sessions (excluding high-impact

Team shall play one (1) game against each of the other
four (4) teams in its Group Stage Group.
(ii) Each Group Stage Group shall include one team from each
of the following subgroups, which are based on the Teams'
winning percentage in the prior Regular Season:
(1) First- through third-highest in the Conference,
(2) Fourth- through sixth-highest in the Conference,
(3) Seventh- through ninth-highest in the Conference,
(4) Tenth- through twelfth-highest in the Conference, and
(5) Thirteenth- through fifteenth-highest in the Conference.
(b) Knockout Stage.
(i) Eight (8) Teams shall participate in the knockout stage:

shall be the Team from each Conference with the best
winning percentage in group stage games that finished
second in the standings in group stage games in its
Group Stage Group.
(ii) Each game in the knockout stage shall be a single elimination
game (i.e., the Team that wins such game shall advance to
the next round of the knockout stage and the Team that
loses shall be eliminated from the In-Season Tournament).(iii) For the first round of the knockout stage (the "IST
Quarterfinals"), in each Conference, (A) the Team with the
highest winning percentage in group stage games shall host
the "wildcard" Team, and (B) the Team with the
second-highest winning percentage in group stage games
shall host the Team with the third-highest winning
percentage in group stage games.
(iv) The games in the second round of the knockout stage (the
"IST Semifinals Games") and the In-Season Tournament
championship game (the "IST Finals Game") shall be played
at a neutral site (i.e., not the home arena for any participating

(v) A player (including a Two-Way Player) shall not be eligible
to participate in the IST Finals Game with a participating
Team if such player was not on such Team's roster as of the
start of the first scheduled IST Semifinals Game.
(vi) The twenty-two (22) teams that do not participate in the
knockout stage shall each play two (2) additional Regular
Season games during the knockout stage on days on which

Regular Season game during the knockout stage on days on
which knockout stage games are not scheduled.
(c) Each game played as part of the In-Season Tournament other than

(d) League Honors. Each Season, players will be selected for Most
Valuable In-Season Tournament Player and All-Tournament Team honorsbased on their performance in group stage games and knockout stage games
in the In-Season Tournament that Season.
(e) Players Association Event. The Players Association may schedule
and hold a public event to be included on the official NBA calendar for the
In-Season Tournament, with such event subject to approval by the NBA.
The NBA and Players Association shall work together in good faith to avoid
scheduling such Players Association event at the same time as a public NBA
event. For clarity, this Section 4(e) shall not preclude the Players Association
from holding other events during the In-Season Tournament that are not
included on the official NBA calendar for the In-Season Tournament.
Section 5. Location and Scheduling of Games.

In-Season Tournament, Play-In, and playoff games in its discretion (subject
to Article XXXIX, Section 5), provided that the number of days beginning
on the date of the first Regular Season game and continuing through the
date of the last Regular Season game each Season shall equal approximately
one hundred seventy-four (174). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
games are cancelled due to one or more events set forth in Article XXXIX,
Section 5 (e.g., weather or natural disasters) or any other unexpected game
cancellation (e.g., due to unexpected unavailability of a Team's arena or
transportation), the NBA may reschedule any such cancelled game(s) in its
discretion, after consulting with the Players Association.
(c) Prior to the NBA's public announcement of the Regular Season
game schedule each year, the NBA shall provide the Players Association
with an initial draft of such schedule (no later than the date that such draft
is provided to all NBA teams), and the Players Association shall have an
opportunity to provide the NBA with comments (within at least as many
days as NBA teams are given by the NBA to provide such comments). The
NBA shall identify for the Players Association any game(s) included in such
draft schedule in which a Team is scheduled to play on the same day thatsuch Team has traveled across two (2) time zones. The NBA shall consider,
but shall have no obligation to make any changes in respect of, the Players
Association's comments regarding the draft schedule. The Players
Association shall keep the draft schedule confidential, including by
maintaining the confidentiality of any differences between the final schedule
publicly announced by the NBA and the draft schedule previously received
by the Players Association.
Section 6. Holidays.
(a) No Team will be required to play a game on December 25, unless
such game is to be telecast or cablecast nationally.
(b) Games scheduled to be played on January 1 and Good Friday shall
not commence prior to 6 p.m. (local time), unless the Players Association
consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Players Association will, upon request, consent to the earlier
commencement of two (2) games on Good Friday and four (4) games on
January 1 if such games are to be broadcast or cablecast nationally, and
provided that the Teams involved are in the same time zone or otherwise in
close geographic proximity.
(c) Teams at home on December 25 and January 1 (each, a "Holiday")
may, but shall not be required to, conduct a practice on either (or both) of
such Holidays, provided: (i) the Team's players have requested that they
practice on the Holiday, as communicated to the Team by the Team's player
representative; and (ii) within seven (7) days before or after the Holiday, the
Team's players are provided with a "day off" – i.e., the Team will not conduct
any practice, including any optional practice, on such date, and the Team
will not have a scheduled game on such date.
(d) Teams shall not depart for an away game or series of away games
prior to 3 p.m. (local time) on December 25 or January 1, unless reasonable
transportation arrangements for such game or games cannot be made at or
after 3 p.m. (local time).
Section 7. All-Star.
No Team that plays a game on the Thursday prior to the All-Star Game
shall play a game on the Tuesday following the All-Star Game or conduct a
practice session prior to such Tuesday at 2 p.m. (local time).Section 8. Travel.
The NBA and its Teams shall use their best efforts to devise reasonable
travel schedules when Team training camps, Exhibition games, and Regular
Season games are conducted or played outside the United States and
Canada.
Section 9. Days Off.
(a) Each Team will provide a minimum of eighteen (18) Days Off
during each Regular Season for each of its players on dates to be determined
by the Team. A "Day Off" means a calendar day on which a player is not
required or permitted to participate in any Team directed activities,
including, but not limited to, games, practices, travel, or promotional
activities. Without limitation, Days Off shall include days that satisfy the
foregoing definition and are provided: (i) during All-Star Weekend pursuant
to Article XXI, Section 4 (only with respect to players not participating in
All-Star activities); and (ii) in locations other than the Team's home city
(such as when the Team is "on the road"). Under no circumstances shall a
Team pressure or coerce a player into providing services for the Team on a
player's Day Off. Nothing contained herein shall prevent any player on his
Day Off from voluntarily engaging in individual basketball related activity at
the Team's facility or elsewhere (including, but not limited to, individual
activity with Team coaches, trainers, or medical personnel). Each Team
shall maintain a list of the Days Off provided to each player on such Team
during the Regular Season.
(b) A calendar day shall not fail to meet the definition of a Day Off
because the Team is traveling on such day, provided the Team lands at its
destination point (i.e., lands at its destination airport or, if the Team has not
flown and is instead traveling by train or bus, arrives at the final destination
of such train or bus) before:
(i) 1:00 a.m. (local time at the destination point) on such day if,
at the time of departure, the local time at the departure point
(i.e., the airport from which the Team departs, or if the Team
has not flown, the point from which the Team's form of
transportation, such as a train or bus, departs) is the same or
later than the local time at the destination point, or(ii) 2:00 a.m. (local time at the destination point) on such day if,
at the time of departure, the local time at the departure point
is earlier than the local time at the destination point.
For any calendar day on which the Team arrives at its destination point at
or after 1:00 a.m. (local time at the destination point) that (a) could not meet
the definition of a Day Off in accordance with subsection (i) above, and
(b) could meet the definition of a Day Off in accordance with subsection (ii)
above, in order for such calendar day to meet the definition of a Day Off,
the Team must, before concluding traveling as a team (i.e., before the players
who traveled with the Team disembark from the final plane, train, or bus),
notify the one or more players who traveled with the Team and will be
provided a Day Off on that calendar day that they will be provided a Day
Off on that calendar day.
(c) For a player whose Player Contract is entered into after the first day
of the Regular Season, the Team will provide a minimum number of Days
Off during such Regular Season, rounded up or down to the nearest whole
Day Off, calculated by multiplying 18 by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days covered by the Player Contract during such Regular
Season (including the day on which the Player Contract is entered into), and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Regular
Season; provided, however, that:
(i) A Team is not required to provide any Day Off to a player
during a Regular Season if the term of his Player Contract
covers fewer than 25 days during such NBA Regular Season
(including the day on which the Player Contract is entered
into). Teams are also not required to provide any Day Off
to a player whose Player Contract is a Two-Way Contract;
and
(ii) A player who signs a Rest-of-Season Contract after March 1
of a Regular Season may waive his right to receive Days Off
pursuant to this Section 9 for such Regular Season. Such
waiver must be in writing, signed by the player, and
approved by the Players Association.
(d) For a player whose Player Contract is assigned by one Team to
another Team during a Regular Season via trade or the NBA's waiverprocedure, the assignor Team's obligation pursuant to Article XX,
Section 9(a) shall be deemed satisfied with respect to the player for such
Regular Season, and the acquiring Team will provide the player a minimum
number of Days Off during such Regular Season calculated as if the player
had entered into a Rest-of-Season Contract: (i) in the case of a trade, on the
date that all conditions to the trade are satisfied; or (ii) in the case of a waiver
claim, on the date that the acquiring Team acquires the player's Contract
pursuant to the NBA waiver procedure.
(e) In the event that any Season does not include at least an eighty-two
(82) game Regular Season schedule, the requirements of Sections 9(a)-(d)
above shall not apply and the NBA and Players Association will negotiate
an alternate Days Off rule for such Season.
