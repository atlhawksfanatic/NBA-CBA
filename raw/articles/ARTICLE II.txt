annexed hereto as Exhibit A.
Section 2. Limitation on Amendments.
(a) Except as provided in Sections 3, 6, 7(d), 9, 10, and 12 of this Article,
and in Article VII, Section 7 (Extensions, Renegotiations, and Other
Amendments) or Article XII (Option Clauses), no amendments to the form
of Uniform Player Contract provided for by Section 1 of this Article shall
be permitted.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 2(a) above, except as provided: (i) in

containing an amendment not specifically permitted by this Agreement or

amendment is not specifically permitted by this Agreement, then such
Contract or subsequent amendment, as the case may be, shall be
disapproved by the Commissioner and, consequently, rendered null and
void.
Section 3. Allowable Amendments.
In their individual contract negotiations, a player and a Team may amend
the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, but only in the following
respects:(a) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Compensation to be paid or
amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract for
rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such
Contract.
(b) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses, and the payment
date for each such bonus, to be paid as a result of: (i) the player's execution
of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a "signing bonus"); (ii) the
player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his
performance as a player or the Team's performance during a particular NBA
Season, subject to the limitations imposed by Paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform
Player Contract and Section 12(d) below; or (iii) the player's achievement of
agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his physical condition or academic
achievement (e.g., earning a college degree or completion of a certified
leadership training program), including the player's attendance at and
participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill
and/or conditioning program upon terms and conditions agreed upon by
the Team and player (subject to the provisions of Section 12(c) below). Any
amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of this
Section 3(b) must be structured so as to provide an incentive for positive
achievement by the player and/or the Team; and any amendment agreed
upon pursuant to subsection (ii) must be based upon specific numerical
benchmarks or Generally Recognized League Honors. By way of example
and not limitation, an amendment agreed upon pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii)
may provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage
exceeds eighty percent (80%), but may not provide for the player to receive
a bonus if his free-throw percentage improves over his previous Season's
percentage. For purposes of any bonus agreed upon pursuant to
subsection (ii), the performance benchmarks must be based solely upon
official NBA statistics, and the determination of whether a player has earned
any such performance bonus shall be made solely by reference to official
NBA statistics as published on NBA.com.
(c) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) with respect to extra promotional appearances to
be performed by the player (in addition to those required by Paragraph 13
of such Contract) and the Compensation therefor.(d) By agreeing upon a Compensation payment schedule (to be set forth
in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) different from that provided for
by Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract; provided, however, that
such amendment shall comply with the provisions of Section 3(b) above
(relating to lump sum bonus payments) and Section 13(e) below and,
provided, further that: (i) the only such amendment that shall be permitted
with respect to any Season in which the player's Compensation is not greater
than the Minimum Player Salary shall be as described in Section 6(g) or
Section 11(a)(ii) below; and (ii) the only such amendments that shall be
permitted with respect to any Season in which the player's Compensation is
greater than the Minimum Player Salary shall be as follows: (y) a Uniform
Player Contract may provide for the player's Compensation (other than
advances pursuant to clause (z) below and amounts paid on a deferred basis
in accordance with Article XXV of this Agreement) to be paid in either
twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments or thirty-six (36) equal
semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on
November 1 of each year covered by the Contract and continuing with such
payments on the first and fifteenth of each month until said Compensation
is paid in full; and (z) a Uniform Player Contract that, at the time the
Contract is signed, is fully or partially protected for lack of skill and injury
or illness for a Season may provide for the player to be paid a portion of his
Compensation for such Season, up to the Maximum Advance Amount as
defined below, prior to November 1 of such Season. The Maximum
Advance Amount for a Season shall equal the lesser of eighty percent (80%)
of the amount of the player's Compensation for such Season that is
protected for lack of skill and injury or illness, or fifty percent (50%) of the
player's Base Compensation for such Season; provided that no more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the player's Base Compensation for such
Season may be paid to the player prior to the October 1 immediately
preceding the first day of the Regular Season.
(e) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1A to a
Uniform Player Contract) stating that the Contract is intended to provide
for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no
bonuses of any kind) for each Season of the Contract for rendering the
services and performing the obligations described in such Contract, in
accordance with Section 6 below.
(f) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1B to a
Uniform Player Contract) (i) setting forth the Compensation to be paid tothe player (with no bonuses of any kind) for each Season of the Contract for
rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such
Contract as a Two-Way Player, in accordance with Section 11 below (a
"Two-Way Contract"), and (ii) containing a Standard NBA Contract
Conversion Option in accordance with Section 11(f) below.
(g) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 or
Exhibit 1A to a Uniform Player Contract, as applicable), subject to the
provisions of Article XXIV, prohibiting or limiting the Team's right to trade
such Contract to another Team.
(h) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 or
Exhibit 1A to a Uniform Player Contract, as applicable) stating that a player

Contract) shall be, in whole or in part, and subject to the standard conditions
or limitations set forth in Section 4 below (and in the form of Exhibit 2) and
any additional conditions or limitations that are negotiated by the player and
Team to the extent permitted in accordance with Section 4(l) below,

("basketball-related injury"), or disability or unfitness to play
skilled basketball resulting from any injury or illness not

player's benefit ("injury or illness"), provided that a Contract
can contain protection in only one of the two categories setforth in this Section 3(i)(iii), and further provided that, for
clarity and without limitation, protection for injury or illness
shall not include protection for mental disability; and/or
(iv) mental disability not covered by an insurance policy
procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("mental
disability").
(j) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 3 to a
Uniform Player Contract) limiting or eliminating the player's right to receive
his Base Compensation (in accordance with Paragraphs 7(c), 16(a)(iii), and

unfitness to play skilled basketball is caused by the re-injury of one or more
injuries sustained prior to, or by the aggravation of one or more conditions
that existed prior to, the execution of the Uniform Player Contract providing
for such Base Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions set forth in Exhibit 3 to a Uniform Player Contract shall not apply
for a Season in the event such Contract is terminated during the period from
the February 1 of such Season through the end of that Season.

Player Contract in its entirety, or (ii) to delete the last sixteen (16) words of
the first sentence of Paragraph 13(b) of such Contract.
(p) By agreeing upon provisions for the purpose of terminating an
already-existing Uniform Player Contract prior to the expiration of its stated
term, stating as follows: (i) the Team will request waivers on the player in

Commissioner's approval of such amendment; and (ii) should the player
clear waivers and his Contract thereupon be terminated (x) the amount of
any Compensation protection contained in the Contract will immediately be

Section 8(e).
(r) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 9 to a
Uniform Player Contract) eliminating the player's right to receive his Base
Compensation (in accordance with Paragraphs 7(c), 16(a)(iii), and 16(b) of
the Uniform Player Contract) in the event the Contract is terminated prior
to the first day of the Regular Season covered by such Contract; provided,
however, that such amendment shall be permitted only if: (i) the Contract
is for one (1) Season in length, provides for the Minimum Player Salary (with
no bonuses of any kind) or Two-Way Salary and does not provide for
Compensation protection of any kind pursuant to Section 3(i) above (a
"Non-Guaranteed, Training Camp Contract"); (ii) at the time of signing the
Non-Guaranteed, Training Camp Contract, the Team has no fewer than
fourteen (14) players signed to Player Contracts (not including any player
signed to a Two-Way Contract or a Non-Guaranteed, Training Camp
Contract) on the Team's roster in respect of the upcoming (or, after the firstday of training camp, the then-current) Season; and (iii) no Team may be a
party at any one time to more than six (6) Non-Guaranteed, Training Camp
Contracts.
(s) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 10 to a
Uniform Player Contract), subject to Section 11(h) below:
(i) entitling a player to receive a bonus (the "Exhibit 10 Bonus")
in an amount between \$5,000 and the "Maximum Exhibit 10
Bonus Amount" (defined below) for the Salary Cap Year in
which the Contract is signed if (1) the Contract is terminated
by the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure
prior to the first day of the Regular Season, and (2) the player
(a) signs with the NBAGL prior to the deadline set by the
NBAGL for NBAGL teams to designate affiliate players,
(b) is initially assigned by the NBAGL to such Team's
NBAGL affiliate as listed in Exhibit 10 and timely reports to
such affiliate, and (c) does not leave the NBAGL (e.g., by
buying out his contract with the NBAGL and signing a
contract with an international team) prior to providing
sixty (60) consecutive days of service during the NBAGL
Season (the "60-Day Service Period"), provided that, in the
event the player is signed to one or more Contract(s) by the
Team prior to completing the 60-Day Service Period, the
player shall still satisfy this clause (c) if he timely returns to
such Team's NBAGL affiliate upon the completion or
termination of such Contract(s) and completes the
outstanding portion of the 60-Day Service Period. For
clarity, a player will not satisfy this clause (c) if at any time
prior to completing the 60-Day Service Period he signs a
contract with a professional basketball team other than the
Team. In the event a player fails to satisfy clause (c) above
as a result of an injury resulting directly from his playing for
the Team's NBAGL affiliate, such player shall nonetheless
be entitled to receive the Exhibit 10 Bonus set forth in his
Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, an Exhibit 10 may only contain an Exhibit 10
Bonus if the Team has an NBAGL affiliate at the time of the
execution of the Contract; provided, however, that if a Team
with an NBAGL affiliate acquires by assignment a Contractwith a Conversion Protection Amount but without an
Exhibit 10 Bonus (the "Acquired Exhibit 10"), the Acquired
Exhibit 10 shall be deemed to include an Exhibit 10 Bonus
equal to the Conversion Protection Amount; and
(ii) stating that, if prior to the first day of the Regular Season
(A) the Team exercises the Two-Way Player Conversion
Option in accordance with Section 11(h) below, and/or
(B) the Contract is not terminated by the Team, the
Compensation provided for by the Contract will be
protected for lack of skill and injury or illness in an amount
(the "Conversion Protection Amount") between \$5,000 and
the Maximum Exhibit 10 Bonus Amount; provided,
however, that if the Exhibit 10 contains an Exhibit 10
Bonus, the Exhibit 10 must also contain a Conversion
Protection Amount and the Conversion Protection Amount
must be equal to the Exhibit 10 Bonus.
The "Maximum Exhibit 10 Bonus Amount" shall be: (1) \$75,000 for the
2023-24 Salary Cap Year, and (2) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year,
\$75,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Salary Cap
for the applicable Salary Cap Year and the denominator of which is the
Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.
In the event that NBAGL rules permit a Team, other than the Team that
last requested waivers on the player, to designate the player as an affiliate
player (the "Designating Team"), the Designating Team shall be responsible
for paying the Exhibit 10 Bonus to the player provided that (a) the
Designating Team designates the player as an affiliate player, (b) prior to the
waiver, the Designating Team was a party to the Contract containing the
Exhibit 10 Bonus, and (c) the player satisfies the conditions set forth in
Section 3(s)(i) above with respect to the Designating Team's NBAGL
affiliate.
With respect to a player, if the NBAGL affiliate of an NBA Team is
permitted, pursuant to NBAGL rules, to designate the player as a returning
player (such NBA Team, the "Returning Rights Team"), then any Team
other than the Returning Rights Team shall, prior to entering into a Contract
containing an Exhibit 10 with the player, be required to provide written
notice to the player (with a copy to the Players Association) that, pursuantto NBAGL rules, the NBAGL affiliate of the Returning Rights Team holds
the right to so designate the player. The NBA shall impose a fine of no less
than \$25,000 on any Team that fails to provide the notice required by this
paragraph.
No Team may (a) be a party at any one time to more than six (6) Contracts
containing an Exhibit 10, or (b) enter into a Player Contract with an
Exhibit 10 unless such Contract is for one (1) Season in length, provides for
the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind other than the
Exhibit 10 Bonus), and does not provide for Compensation protection of
any kind pursuant to Section 3(i) above (other than in connection with
Section 3(s)(ii) above).
A Team may enter into a Contract with both an Exhibit 9 and an Exhibit 10
in accordance with the preceding terms; provided, however, that if a Team
exercises its Two-Way Player Conversion Option, the Contract's Exhibit 9
shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect upon the
exercise of such Two-Way Player Conversion Option.
Section 4. Compensation Protection.
(a) Lack of Skill. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part,
the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the

Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit;

whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 (or
Exhibit 1A or Exhibit 1B, as applicable) to such Contract in the amounts
and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such

shall any such agreement afford the player any right to be employed, or to
be deemed as having been employed, by such Team for any purpose.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for by a Uniform Player Contract, and such protection is
contingent on the satisfaction of a condition expressly set forth in Exhibit 2
to that Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the
Player Contract has not previously been terminated at the time such
condition is satisfied.
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for in any Option Year in favor of the Team included in a Uniform
Player Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the
option to extend the term provided for in the Contract was exercised by the
Team prior to the termination of the Contract. When a Team agrees to
protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for in any
Option Year in favor of the player, the applicability of such protection in
the circumstance where the Option has not been exercised by the player
shall be governed by the provisions of Article XII, Section 2(a).
(i) During the term of a Player Contract, the percentage of protected
Base Compensation for any future Season shall not exceed the percentage
of unearned protected Base Compensation for any prior Season. Thus, for
example, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50%) Base
Compensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one
hundred percent (100%) Base Compensation protection in the second
Season of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a
Team from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a
future Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of Base
Compensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition cannot
be satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example, it ispermissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation protection
for the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent (50%) and Base
Compensation protection for the second Season will be increased from fifty
percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) if the player is on the Team's
roster as of the August 1 prior to the second Season of the Player Contract.
(j) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after
the effective date of this Agreement:
(i) The maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation
that can be protected for death is thirty million dollars
(\$30,000,000); and
(ii) If a player (other than a player signed to a Contract that
provides in any Season for the player to earn Compensation
equal to his applicable Minimum Player Salary that (x) is
signed after the first day of the Regular Season, or (y) does
not provide for full Base Compensation protection for lack
of skill and injury or illness for the first Season of such
Contract) elects to purchase term life insurance for his
benefit, his Team shall be permitted to reimburse him each
Season for the premiums paid for such insurance with
respect to such Season and any other future Season(s);
provided, however, that:
(A) The amount of coverage for which premiums are
reimbursed by the Team in any Season shall not
exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the
player's unearned Base Compensation for such
Season and each remaining Season (excluding an
Option Year if not yet exercised) that is not
protected for death, and (y) the difference between
(i) eighty-five million dollars (\$85,000,000) and
(ii) the aggregate amount of the player's unearned
Base Compensation for such Season and each
remaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not
yet exercised) that is protected for death.(B) Any such premium reimbursement shall not exceed
the cost for ten-year guaranteed term coverage at
preferred rates.
(iii) If a Contract contains death protection covering ten million
dollars (\$10,000,000) or more of Base Compensation, the
player shall be precluded from purchasing life insurance for
a period of ninety (90) days following the execution or
extension (as applicable) of the Contract or until such earlier
time as the Team notifies the player in writing that it is no
longer attempting to purchase life insurance coverage on the
player (up to the amount of the player's Base Compensation
protection for death) for the Team's benefit. During such
ninety (90) day period or until such time as the Team issues
the foregoing written notification to the player, the Team's
efforts to purchase life insurance on the player for the
Team's benefit shall be conducted diligently and in good
faith.
(k) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after
the effective date of this Agreement, in the event that a Team terminates a
Player Contract (resulting in the player's separation of service from the
Team), and the Team is obligated thereafter to make payments to the player
pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract, such payments shall be made in
accordance with the following schedule:
(i) If, as of the date of the player's separation from service, the
aggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant
to Exhibit 2 of the Contract is five hundred thousand dollars
(\$500,000) or less, such amount shall be paid in accordance
with the semi-monthly installments prescribed by the
payment schedule set forth in the Contract. Each
installment shall equal the amount of Base Compensation
that was due per pay period for the applicable Season
immediately before the Player's separation until the
aggregate amount of the remaining Base Compensation
owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract is
paid in full.(ii) If, as of the date of the player's separation from service, the
aggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant
to Exhibit 2 of the Contract exceeds five hundred thousand
dollars (\$500,000), such amount shall be paid as follows:
(x) The Base Compensation, if any, owed to the player
pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect
to the "current season" (as defined below) at the
time when the request for waivers on the player is
made shall be paid in accordance with the payment
schedule set forth in the Contract. Each installment
shall equal the amount of Base Compensation that
was due per pay period immediately before the
player's separation until the aggregate amount of the
remaining Base Compensation owed to the player
pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect
to the current season is paid in full. For purposes of
this subparagraph (x) and subparagraph (y) below
only, the "current season" means the period from
September 1 through June 30.
(y) The remaining Base Compensation, if any, owed to
the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall
be aggregated and paid in equal amounts per year
over a period equal to twice the number of NBA
Seasons (including any Season covered by a Player
Option Year) remaining on this Contract following
the date upon which the request for waivers
occurred, plus one NBA Season. For this purpose,
if the request for waivers is made during the period
from September 1 through June 30, the number of
NBA Seasons remaining on this Contract shall not
include the current season (as defined in
subparagraph (x) above). The rescheduled payments
described above shall be paid over the applicable
number of NBA Seasons in equal semi-monthly
installments on the pay dates prescribed by
Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract.The following example is for clarity. A player has four (4) Seasons remaining
on his Contract with protected Base Compensation of the following
amounts: \$4 million in Season 1, \$4.3 million in Season 2, \$4.7 million in
Season 3, and \$5 million in Season 4. The player is waived on December 1
of Season 1. Under Section 4(k)(ii)(x) above, the player would receive the
remainder of his \$4 million in Base Compensation for Season 1 in
accordance with the payment schedule set forth in his Contract. Under
Section 4(k)(ii)(y) above, the \$14 million of protected Base Compensation
remaining to be paid for Seasons 2-4 of the Contract would be paid at a rate
of \$2 million per Season for the next seven (7) Seasons in accordance with
the payment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract. If the same
player is instead waived on July 30 prior to Season 1, the \$18 million of
protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 1-4 of the
Contract would be paid – under Section 4(k)(ii) above – at a rate of
\$2 million per Season for the next nine (9) Seasons in accordance with the
payment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract.
(l) In addition to the standard conditions or limitations set forth above
in this Section 4 (as set forth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player
Contract), a Team and a player are authorized under Article II,
Sections 4(a)-(e) to negotiate additional conditions or limitations applicable
to the player's Compensation protection for such categories as the Team
and player agree to protect that relate to only the following: (i) whether the
Team waives a player by a certain time (e.g., providing that a player's Base
Compensation protection increases if the Team does not request waivers on
the player by a certain date); (ii) achievement of certain benchmarks relating
to Team and/or player performance or a player's physical condition
(e.g., providing that a player's Base Compensation protection increases if the
player achieves certain performance criteria or meets specified weigh-in
criteria), provided that any such performance benchmarks must be based
solely upon official NBA statistics, the determination of whether a player
has met any such performance benchmark shall be made solely by reference
to official NBA statistics as published on NBA.com, and any amendment
agreed upon pursuant to this subsection is structured so as to provide an
incentive for positive achievement by the Team and/or the player; (iii) a
player experiencing a particular injury, illness, or other medical condition
(e.g., providing that a player's Base Compensation protection does not apply
if the Team terminates a Contract due to a particular injury to a player's left
knee); and (iv) the Team's ability to obtain insurance, using best efforts, of
a certain type and dollar amount within a specified period of time followingexecution or extension (as applicable) of the Contract. Other than the
standard conditions or limitations set forth above in this Section 4 (as set
forth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract) and any
individually-negotiated conditions or limitations in accordance with this
Section (l), no Player Contract entered into or extended on or after the
effective date of this Agreement (but in the case of Extensions only with
respect to the extended term) may contain any additional condition or
limitation of any kind on a player's Compensation protection.
Section 5. Conformity.
(a) All currently effective Player Contracts, and all Player Contracts
entered into on or after the effective date of this Agreement that do not
otherwise so provide, shall be deemed amended in such manner to require
the parties to comply with all terms of this Agreement, including the terms
of the Uniform Player Contract annexed hereto as Exhibit A. All Player
Contracts shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, which shall
supersede the terms of any Player Contract inconsistent herewith. No Player
Contract shall provide for the waiver by a player or a Team of any benefits
or the sacrifice of any rights to which the player or the Team is entitled by
virtue of a Uniform Player Contract or this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 5(a) above, no Player Contract entered into
prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be affected by any
provisions of this Agreement expressly indicating that they apply only to
Player Contracts entered into on or after the effective date of this
Agreement.
Section 6. Minimum Player Salary.
(a) Except with respect to 10-Day Contracts provided for in Section 9
below, Rest-of-Season Contracts provided for in Section 10 below, and
Two-Way Contracts provided for in Section 11 below, no Player Contract
shall provide for a Salary of less than the applicable scale amount contained
in the Minimum Annual Salary Scale applicable for such Salary Cap Year.
The Minimum Annual Salary Scale applicable to a player's Contract is
determined by the Salary Cap Year encompassing the first Season covered
by the Contract. Accordingly, for example, if the first Season covered by a
player's Contract is the 2023-24 Season, then the Minimum Annual SalaryScale for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year shall apply for each Season of the
Contract.
(b) No 10-Day Contract or Rest-of-Season Contract (as those terms are
defined in Sections 9 and 10 below) shall provide for a Salary of less than
the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player.
(c) In determining whether a Player Contract provides for a Salary of
no less than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player, the
allocation of a deemed signing bonus in respect of an "international player
payment" in excess of the Excluded International Player Payment Amount
for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in Article VII, Section 3(e) (but no
other bonuses) shall be considered as part of the Salary provided for by a
Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear that the
Salary for each Season (including the allocation of any such deemed signing
bonus) equals or exceeds the Minimum Player Salary for such Season.
(d) On July 1 of each Salary Cap Year, any Player Contract (other than
a Two-Way Contract), whether entered into before or after the effective date
of this Agreement, that provides for a Salary for the upcoming Season that
is less than the applicable Minimum Player Salary based on the Minimum
Annual Salary Scale applicable to the player's Contract shall be deemed
amended to provide for the applicable Minimum Player Salary based on such
Minimum Annual Salary Scale.
(e) Nothing in this Section 6 shall alter the respective rights and
liabilities of a player and a Team, as provided for in the Uniform Player
Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the termination of a Player
Contract.
(f) Every Contract entered into between a player and Team that is
intended to provide for Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary
(with no bonuses of any kind) for each Season must contain the following
sentence in Exhibit 1A of such Contract and shall be deemed amended in
the manner described in such sentence: "This Contract is intended to
provide for a Base Compensation for the ____________ Season(s) equal to
the Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s) (with no bonuses of any kind)
and shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to so provide." The
reference in the preceding sentence to "no bonuses of any kind" shall not
be construed to limit the ability of a Team and player (i) to agree uponprovisions entitling a player to earn Compensation if such player's Uniform
Player Contract is traded to another NBA team in accordance with Section
3(k) above, or (ii) to enter into a Contract with an Exhibit 10 Bonus, subject
to the limitations in Section 3(s) above and Section 11(h) below.
(g) A Uniform Player Contract (other than a Two-Way Contract) that
provides in any Season for the player to earn Compensation not greater than
his applicable Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind) that, at
the time the Contract is signed, is fully or partially protected for lack of skill
and injury or illness may be amended to provide for the player to be paid a
portion of his Compensation for such Season (the "Advance"), up to the
Minimum Player Salary Advance Limit as defined below, prior to
November 1 of such Season. The Minimum Player Salary Advance Limit
for a Season shall equal the lesser of (i) eighty percent (80%) of the amount
of the player's Compensation for such Season that is protected for lack of
skill and injury or illness, or (ii) seven and one half percent (7.5%) of the
player's Base Compensation for such Season. Any Advance paid to a player
for a Season pursuant to the foregoing must be deducted in full from the
first installment of Current Base Compensation (i.e., on November 1) and,
if necessary after reducing in full the first installment, the second installment
of Current Base Compensation (i.e., on November 15) for such Season that
the player would have received pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) of the Contract
had there been no such Advance. To effectuate the requirement set forth
in the preceding sentence, every such Contract that provides for an Advance
must contain the following language (and only such language) under the
"Payment Schedule" heading in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 1A (as applicable) with
respect to each applicable Season:
"Player's Current Base Compensation with respect to the
_________ Season(s) shall be paid in accordance with
Paragraph 3(a), except that the November 1 installment of
such Current Base Compensation and, if necessary after
reducing in full the November 1 installment, the November
15 installment of such Current Base Compensation shall be
reduced by \$[amount of Advance], which amount shall be
paid to Player in advance on [date]."Section 7. Maximum Annual Salary.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Player
Contract entered into on or after the effective date of this Agreement may
provide for a Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first Season covered by the
Contract that exceeds the following amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Salary Cap in effect at the time the Contract is executed,
or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the Salary for the
final Season of the player's prior Contract; provided,
however, that a player who has four (4) Years of Service as
of the June 30 following the end of the last Season covered
by his Player Contract ("5th Year Eligible Players") shall be
eligible to receive from his Prior Team up to thirty
percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the
Contract is executed if the player has met at least one of the
following criteria (the "Higher Max Criteria") as of the July 1
following the player's fourth Season:
(A) the player was named to the All-NBA first, second,
or third team, or was named Defensive Player of the
Year, in the immediately preceding Season or in
two (2) Seasons during the immediately preceding
three (3) Seasons; or
(B) the player was named NBA MVP during one of the
immediately preceding three (3) Seasons;
(ii) for any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer
than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty
percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the
Contract is executed, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%)
of the Salary for the final Season of the player's prior
Contract; provided, however, that a player who has eight (8)
or nine (9) Years of Service at the time the Contract is
executed and rendered such Years of Service for the Team
with which he first executed a Player Contract (or, if he was
under a Player Contract for more than one Team during
such period, changed Teams only by trade during the firstfour (4) Salary Cap Years in which he was under a Player
Contract) shall be eligible to enter into a Designated Veteran
Player Contract pursuant to which he receives from his Prior
Team up to thirty-five percent (35%) of the Salary Cap in
effect at the time the Contract is executed if the player has
met at least one of the Higher Max Criteria at the time his
Contract is executed; or
(iii) for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of
Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect at the time the Contract is executed, or
(y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the Salary for the
final Season of the player's prior Contract.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Renegotiation may provide for a Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the
Renegotiation Season (as defined in Article VII, Section 7(c)) that exceeds
the following amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is
executed, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the
Salary for the Season prior to the Renegotiation Season;
(ii) for any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer
than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty
percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the
Renegotiation is executed, or (y) one hundred five (105%) of
the Salary for the Season prior to the Renegotiation Season;
or
(iii) for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of
Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is executed,
or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the Salary for the
Season prior to the Renegotiation Season.
(c) The parties recognize that it may not be possible to ascertain at the
time an Extension is executed whether the Salary plus Unlikely Bonusescalled for in the first Season of the extended term will exceed the Maximum
Annual Salary set forth in this Section 7. Accordingly, and notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the following rule shall apply to any
Extension in which the extended term begins on or after the effective date
of this Agreement: if, on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year encompassing the
first Season of the extended term of such Extension, the Salary plus Unlikely
Bonuses provided for in such Season exceeds the following amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Salary Cap in effect on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year
encompassing the first Season of the extended term of such
Extension, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the
Salary provided for in the final Season of the original term
of the Contract; provided, however, that a 5th Year Eligible
Player who signed a Rookie Scale Extension in accordance
with Section 7(d) below shall be eligible to receive the
percentage that is agreed upon by the Team and player,
which shall be no less than twenty-five percent (25%) or
greater than thirty percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect
on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year encompassing the first
Season of the extended term of such Extension if the player
has met at least one of the Higher Max Criteria;
(ii) for any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer
than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of (x) thirty
percent (30%) of the Salary Cap in effect on July 1 of the
Salary Cap Year encompassing the first Season of the
extended term of such Extension, or (y) one hundred five
percent (105%) of the Salary provided for in the final Season
of the original term of the Contract; provided, however, that
a player who (A) has one Season, or two Seasons (including
any Option Year), remaining on his Contract, and (B) has
seven (7) or eight (8) Years of Service at the time the
Extension is executed (i.e., a player entering their 8th or 9th
year in the NBA), and (C) rendered such Years of Service
for the Team with which he first executed a Player Contract
(or, if he was under a Player Contract for more than one
Team during such period, changed Teams only by trade
during the first four (4) Salary Cap Years in which he wasunder a Player Contract) shall be eligible to enter into a
Designated Veteran Player Extension pursuant to which the
player receives the percentage that is agreed upon by the
Team and player, which shall be no less than thirty percent
(30%) and no greater than thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year
encompassing the first Season of the extended term of such
Extension if the player has met at least one of the Higher
Max Criteria; or
(iii) for any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of
Service, the greater of (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
Salary Cap in effect on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year
encompassing the first Season of the extended term of such
Extension, or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the
Salary provided for in the final Season of the original term
of the Contract;
then such Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses shall immediately be deemed
amended to provide for the maximum amount allowed by the applicable
subsection (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) set forth above as follows: (1) if there is a
signing bonus allocated to the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended
term, the amount of such allocation shall be reduced first; (2) if the reduction
in clause (1) is insufficient to reduce the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses to the
maximum amount allowed pursuant to the applicable subsection (c)(i),
(c)(ii), or (c)(iii) above (including because there is no signing bonus allocated
to the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term) and the Extension
provides for Incentive Compensation, the amount of Likely Bonuses and
Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term
shall be reduced next (on a pro-rata basis); and (3) if the reductions in clauses
(1) and (2) are insufficient to reduce the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses to the
maximum amount allowed pursuant to the applicable subsection (c)(i),
(c)(ii), or (c)(iii) above (including because there is no signing bonus allocated
to the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term and/or the
Extension does not provide for Incentive Compensation), the amount of
Base Compensation provided for in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the
extended term shall be reduced last. In the event that the amount of a
signing bonus allocation is deemed amended pursuant to the foregoing, then
the amount of any signing bonus allocation in respect of each subsequent
Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term shall also immediately bedeemed amended proportionately (e.g., in the event that the amount of a
signing bonus allocation is reduced by 50% in respect of the first Salary Cap
Year covered by the extended term, then the amount of any signing bonus
allocation in respect of each subsequent Salary Cap Year covered by the
extended term shall also be reduced by 50%; and in the event that the
amount of a signing bonus allocation is reduced by 100% in respect of the
first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term, then the amount of any
signing bonus allocation in respect of each subsequent Salary Cap Year
covered by the extended term shall also be reduced by 100%). In the event
that the amount of any Likely Bonuses, Unlikely Bonuses, and/or Base
Compensation is deemed amended pursuant to the foregoing, then the
amount of any Likely Bonuses, Unlikely Bonuses, and/or Base
Compensation in respect of each subsequent Salary Cap Year covered by
the extended term shall also immediately be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to comply with the maximum allowable increases or decreases
over the amended Likely Bonuses, Unlikely Bonuses, and/or Base
Compensation in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term in
accordance with Article VII, Section 5(a).
(d) A player and a Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that
the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal "the
Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player in the first Season of the
extended term" or:
(i) in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for a First Round
Pick who at the time the Extension is executed has already
met at least one of the Higher Max Criteria, the player and
Team may instead provide in the Extension that the player's
Salary (in the first Season of the extended term) will equal
"[_____]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season
of the extended term." The percentage to be included where
brackets are indicated in the foregoing language shall equal
the percentage that is agreed upon by the Team and player,
which shall in no event be less than twenty-five percent
(25%) or greater than thirty percent (30%); or
(ii) in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for any other First
Round Pick (i.e., a First Round Pick who at the time the
Extension is executed had not yet met at least one of the
Higher Max Criteria), the player and Team may insteadprovide in the Extension that the player's Salary (in the first
Season of the extended term) will equal "25% of the Salary
Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term,
or, if the player meets at least one of the applicable Higher
Max Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale
Contract, [ ]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first
Season of the extended term." The percentage to be
included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing
language shall equal the percentage of the Salary Cap that is
agreed upon by the Team and player, which shall in no event
be less than twenty-five percent (25%) or greater than thirty
percent (30%).
(iii) As an alternative to (i) or (ii) above, the Team may instead
provide in the Extension that the player's Salary (in the first
Season of the extended term) will equal alternative
percentages of the Salary Cap (which shall in no event be
less than twenty-five percent (25%) or greater than thirty
percent (30%)) based upon how and whether the player
satisfies the applicable Higher Max Criteria. Accordingly,
for example, with respect to a Rookie Scale Extension in
which the first Season of the extended term commences
with the 2024-25 Season, the Team and player could agree
that the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended
term) would be 25% of the Salary Cap in effect during the
first Season of the extended term, or the applicable
percentage of the Salary Cap set forth below if, during the
fourth Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, the player meets
the Higher Max Criteria set forth opposite such percentage:
Higher Max Criteria Percentage
All-NBA Second Team 27%
All-NBA First Team 28%
NBA MVP 30%
The player and Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that the
Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will be
increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that
comply with Article VII, Section 5(a). In the case of a Rookie Scale
Extension entered into pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above, the player and Teammay instead provide that Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the
extended term will be increased or decreased by a different percentage based
on the percentage of the Salary Cap that the player receives in Salary in the
first Season of the extended term. Any such Rookie Scale Extension shall
be deemed amended on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year covering the first
Season of the extended term to provide for specific Salaries for each Season
of the extended term, based on the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to
such player on such July 1. A Rookie Scale Extension entered into pursuant
to this subsection may not include any Incentive Compensation.
(e) A player and a Team may provide in a Designated Veteran Player
Extension that the player's Salary (in the first Season of the extended term)
will equal "[_____]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of
the extended term." The percentage to be included where brackets are
indicated in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage that is agreed
upon by the Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less
than thirty percent (30%) or greater than thirty-five percent (35%). The
player and Team may provide in a Designated Veteran Player Extension that
the Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will
be increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that
comply with Article VII, Section 5(a). Any such Designated Veteran Player
Extension shall be deemed amended on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year
covering the first Season of the extended term to provide for specific
Salaries for each Season of the extended term, based on the Maximum
Annual Salary applicable to such player on such July 1. A Designated
Veteran Player Extension entered into pursuant to this subsection may not
include any Incentive Compensation.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade
of a Uniform Player Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained
in such Contract, cause the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the
Salary Cap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed the following amounts:
(i) for any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years
of Service, the greater of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus is earned,
or (y) one hundred five percent (105%) of the player's Salary
for the Season prior to the Season in which the trade bonus
is earned, or in the case of a 5th Year Eligible Player who
met at least one of the Higher Max Criteria and signed aContract or Rookie Scale Extension (as applicable) that
provided for up to thirty percent (30%) of the Salary Cap,
[__]% of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the trade bonus
is earned with the applicable percentage where brackets are
indicated equal to the percentage of the Salary Cap paid to
the player in the first year of his Contract or the first year of

Section 9. 10-Day Contracts.
(a) Beginning on January 5 of any NBA Season, a Team may enter into
a Player Contract (other than a Two-Way Contract) with a player for the
longer of (i) ten (10) days, or (ii) a period encompassing three (3) games
played by such Team (a "10-Day Contract").
(b) The Salary provided for by a 10-Day Contract shall be the Minimum
Player Salary.
(c) No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract with the same player
more than twice during the course of any one Season. No Team may be a
party at any one time to more 10-Day Contracts than the following:
Aggregate Number of Players on Team's Maximum Number of
Active List and Inactive List (Including the Team's Players
Players Signed to 10-Day Contracts, But Who Can Be Signed to
Not Including Two-Way Players) 10-Day Contracts
12 0
13 1
14 2
15 3For example, if a Team has thirteen (13) players on its Active List (not
including any Two-Way Players) and no players on its Inactive List, then the
Team may have one player under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team has
thirteen (13) players on its Active List (including one (1) Two-Way Player)
and two (2) players on its Inactive List (not including any Two-Way Players),
then the Team may have two (2) players under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team
has twelve (12) players on its Active List (not including any Two-Way
Players) and three (3) players on its Inactive List (not including any
Two-Way Players), then the Team may have three (3) players under a 10-Day
Contract.
(d) No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract if the length of such
Contract, in accordance with Section 9(a), would extend to or past the date
of the Team's last Regular Season game for such Season.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9(a) or 9(d)
above, in the event the NBA authorizes a Team to sign a Player Contract
pursuant to the NBA's hardship rules, then (i) such Contract shall be a 10-
Day Contract regardless of when during the Season such Contract is signed;
and (ii) if the length of such 10-Day Contract (as determined in accordance
with Section 9(a) above) would extend to or past the date of the Team's last
Regular Season game in such Season, then the term of such 10-Day Contract
shall be the number of days remaining in such Regular Season (including the
day on which the 10-Day Contract is signed).
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in a Uniform
Player Contract, a 10-Day Contract shall be terminated simply by providing
written notice to the player (and not by following the waiver procedure set
forth in Paragraph 16 of the Uniform Player Contract) and paying only such
sums as are set forth in Exhibit 1A of such Contract.
(g) If a player's 10-Day Contract with a Team is terminated by the Team
prior to the expiration of its stated term, then the Team and player shall not
be permitted to enter into a new Contract prior to the expiration of the
stated term of such terminated 10-Day Contract.
(h) A Team and player who are parties to a 10-Day Contract may, prior
to the expiration (or termination, if applicable) of the 10-Day Contract,
negotiate and enter into a Standard NBA Contract that is a Rest-of-SeasonContract (defined below) that will take effect on the day following the date
on which the stated term of such 10-Day Contract expires.
Section 10. Rest-of-Season Contracts.
(a) At any time after the first day of an NBA Regular Season, a Team
may enter into a Player Contract that may provide Compensation to a player
for the remainder of that Season (a "Rest-of-Season Contract").
(b) The Salary provided for in a Rest-of-Season Contract shall not be
less than the Minimum Player Salary.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Two-Way Contracts shall not be
subject to the requirements set forth in this Section 10.
Section 11. Two-Way Contracts.
(a) Two-Way Player Salary.
(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11, an
NBA Team may enter into a Player Contract that provides a
player ("Two-Way Player") with a Salary as set forth in
Section 11(a)(ii) below for providing services to both an
NBAGL team and the NBA Team ("Two-Way Contract").
(ii) The Salary provided for in a Two-Way Contract (the
"Two-Way Player Salary") for a Season shall equal fifty
percent (50%) of the Minimum Annual Salary called for
under Article II, Section 6(a) for a player with zero (0) Years
of Service (irrespective of how many Years of Service the
player has accrued prior to the Contract or accrues during
the term of the Contract), multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the
Regular Season as of the date such Contract is entered into
(including the day on which the Contract is entered into),
and the denominator of which is the total number of days of
that Regular Season.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
no Two-Way Contract may include or provide for any(A) bonuses or Incentive Compensation of any kind,
(B) deferred compensation, or (C) loans.
(iv) Every Two-Way Contract must contain an Exhibit 1B and
include the following sentence in such Exhibit (which shall
be deemed amended in the manner described in such
sentence): "This Contract is intended to provide for a Base
Compensation for the ____________ Season(s) equal to the
Two-Way Player Salary for such Season(s) (with no bonuses
of any kind) and shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to so provide."
(v) A Two-Way Contract that, at the time the Two-Way
Contract is signed, is partially protected for lack of skill and
injury or illness for a Season may be amended to provide for
the Two-Way Player to be paid a portion of his Base
Compensation for such Season (the "Advance"), up to the
Two-Way Contract Advance Limit as defined below, prior
to November 1 of such Season. The Two-Way Contract
Advance Limit for a Season shall equal fifty percent (50%)
of the amount of the Two-Way Player's Base Compensation
for such Season that is protected for lack of skill and injury
or illness at the time of signing. Any Advance paid to a
player for a Season pursuant to the foregoing must be
deducted from the first installment of Base Compensation
(i.e., on November 1) and, if and as necessary after reducing
in full the first installment, each subsequent installment of
Base Compensation for such Season that such player would
have received pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform
Player Contract had there been no such Advance. To
effectuate the requirement set forth in the preceding
sentence, every such Two-Way Contract that provides for an
Advance must contain the following language (and, with
respect to an Advance, only such language) in Exhibit 1B
with respect to each applicable Season:
"Payment Schedule (if different from
Paragraph 3): Player's Base Compensation
with respect to the _________ Season(s)
shall be paid in accordance withParagraph 3(a), except that the November 1
installment of such Base Compensation and,
if and as necessary after reducing in full the
November 1 installment, each subsequent
installment of such Base Compensation for
such Season shall be reduced by \$[amount of
Advance], which amount shall be paid to
Player in advance on [date]."
(b) Roster Limitations.
(i) No Team may have on its roster at any time more than
three (3) Two-Way Players.
(ii) No player under a Two-Way Contract may be on the Active
List for more than fifty (50) games during a Regular Season.
If a player is signed to a Two-Way Contract after the start of
a Regular Season, the maximum number of games for which
such player may be on the Active List during that Regular
Season shall be fifty (50) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days remaining in such
Regular Season as of the date such Two-Way Contract is
entered into (including the day on which the Two-Way
Contract is entered into), and the denominator of which is
the total number of days of such Regular Season, rounded
to the nearest whole number; provided, however, that in no
event shall the maximum number of games for which a
player may be on the Active List be fewer than one (1).
(iii) Any Regular Season game for which a Team has fewer than
fifteen (15) players signed to Standard NBA Contracts shall
be an "Under-Fifteen Game." No Team shall be permitted
to have a Two-Way Player on its Active List for more than
ninety (90) Under-Fifteen Games during a Regular Season.
For purposes of the foregoing rule: (A) an Under-Fifteen
Game for which a Team has one (1) Two-Way Player on its
Active List shall count as one (1) Under-Fifteen Game;
(B) an Under-Fifteen Game for which a Team has two (2)
Two-Way Players on its Active List shall count as two (2)
Under-Fifteen Games; and (C) an Under-Fifteen Game forwhich a Team has three (3) Two-Way Players on its Active
List shall count as three (3) Under-Fifteen Games.
(c) Compensation Protection.
(i) The maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation
protection for a Season in a Two-Way Contract is the
"Maximum Two-Way Protection Amount" (defined below)
for such Season, provided that if such Contract is signed
after the first day of the Regular Season, the maximum
amount of aggregate Base Compensation protection for
such Season is fifty percent (50%) of the Base Compensation
provided for by such Contract for such Season. In addition,
a Two-Way Contract may also provide for Base
Compensation protection for a Season to increase to up to
fifty percent (50%) of the Base Compensation provided for
by such Contract for such Season if the Team does not
request waivers on the player by a certain date that is on or
after the first day of the Regular Season encompassed by
such Season.
(ii) The "Maximum Two-Way Protection Amount" shall be
\$75,000 for the 2023-24 Season, and for each subsequent
Season shall be \$75,000 multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Salary Cap for the Salary Cap Year
encompassing the applicable Season and the denominator of
which is the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.
(iii) If a Team assigns or terminates a Player Contract that
contains aggregate Base Compensation protection in respect
of the then-current and any future Salary Cap Year that
exceeds the Maximum Two-Way Protection Amount for the
Season encompassed by the Salary Cap Year in which such
assignment or termination occurs, then, during such Salary
Cap Year, the player shall be precluded from: (x) playing
under an NBAGL contract for such Team's NBAGL
affiliate, and (y) entering into a Two-Way Contract with such
Team.(d) Contract Term. The term of a Two-Way Contract may not exceed
two (2) Seasons in length and may not include any Option Year or Early
Termination Option.
(e) Eligibility. The following eligibility rules shall apply to all Two-
Way Contracts:
(i) No Team may sign a player to a Two-Way Contract after
March 4 of any Season.
(ii) No Team may sign or convert a player to a Two-Way
Contract if the player has or may have four (4) or more Years
of Service at any point during the Contract. For example, a
player with three (3) Years of Service would not be eligible
to sign a Two-Way Contract with a term of two (2) years.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Team may sign or convert
a player who has four (4) Years of Service to a Two-Way
Contract covering no more than one (1) Season if the player
was credited with one (1) or more Years of Service in respect
of a Season in which he (A) did not play in a Regular Season,
Play-In, or playoff game and (B) was on a Team's roster at
all times from the first day of the Regular Season through
the end of the last day of the Regular Season.
(iii) No Team may sign or convert a player to a Two-Way
Contract, or acquire a Two-Way Contract by means of
assignment, if, as a result, the player would or could be under
a Two-Way Contract for any part of more than three (3)
Salary Cap Years with the same NBA Team. For example,
a player who completes a two-year Two-Way Contract with
a Team could not subsequently sign a two-year Two-Way
Contract with that Team.
(f) Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option. Every Two-Way
Contract shall provide the Team with an option to convert the Two-Way
Contract during its term to a Contract that is not a Two-Way Contract
("Standard NBA Contract") that provides for a Salary for each Salary Cap
Year equal to the player's applicable Minimum Player Salary and a term equal
to the remainder of the original term of the Two-Way Contract beginning
on the date such option is exercised ("Standard NBA Contract ConversionOption"). Such player's applicable Minimum Player Salary shall be
determined in accordance with Section 6 above. For the day the Standard
NBA Contract Conversion Option is exercised, the player shall be
compensated only under the new Standard NBA Contract, and not under
his Two-Way Contract. The Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option
may be exercised at any point during the period beginning on July 1 and
ending just prior to the start of the Team's last Regular Season game in each
Salary Cap Year covered by the Two-Way Contract. Upon conversion, such
Contract shall become a Standard NBA Contract and shall no longer be
governed by the provisions of this Agreement governing Two-Way
Contracts. To effectuate the requirements set forth in the preceding
sentences, every Two-Way Contract with an Exhibit 1B must contain the
following language (and only such language) under the "Standard NBA
Contract Conversion Option" heading:
"Team shall have the option to convert this Contract to a Standard NBA
Contract ("Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option"). Team's
Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may be exercised by
providing written notice to Player that is either personally delivered to
Player or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified,
registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of Player or his
representative with a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If
Team exercises the Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option, the
Base Compensation amount set forth above in this Exhibit 1B will
immediately become null and void and of no further force or effect,
Player's Compensation shall be equal to the Player's applicable Minimum
Player Salary for a term equal to the remainder of the original term of this
Contract beginning on the date such option is exercised, and all other
terms and conditions of this Contract, including the Base Compensation
protection set forth in Exhibit 2 (if any), shall remain applicable."
(g) Exclusive Rights.
(i) During the term of a Two-Way Contract, the Team that is
the party to the Two-Way Contract shall be the only Team
with which the Two-Way Player may negotiate or sign a
Standard NBA Contract.
(ii) The Team and the Two-Way Player who are parties to such
Two-Way Contract shall have the right to negotiate andagree to a Standard NBA Contract in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or the Uniform Player Contract,
(1) such Standard NBA Contract may not include an
Exhibit 10, and (2) upon execution of the Standard NBA
Contract, the prior Two-Way Contract between the Team
and player will immediately be rendered null and void and of
no further force or effect. For the day the Standard NBA
Contract is executed, the player shall be compensated only
under the new Standard NBA Contract, and not under the
prior Two-Way Contract.
(h) Exhibit 10.
(i) Every Contract with an Exhibit 10 shall provide the Team
with an option (to be set forth in Exhibit 10) to convert the
Contract to a Two-Way Contract that provides for the
Two-Way Player Salary ("Two-Way Player Conversion
Option"); provided, however, that the Two-Way Player
Conversion Option (a) must be exercised prior to the first
day of the NBA Regular Season, and (b) may not be
exercised if it would result in a violation of Article X, Section
4(d). If a Team exercises the Two-Way Player Conversion
Option, (w) the Contract's Exhibit 1A will immediately
become null and void and of no further force or effect and
the Player's Compensation shall be equal to the Two-Way
Player Salary applicable for such Season, (x) the Player's
right to an Exhibit 10 Bonus (if applicable) will be rescinded,
(y) the Player's Contract, notwithstanding the absence of an
Exhibit 2, shall have Base Compensation protection for lack
of skill and injury or illness at an amount equal to the
Conversion Protection Amount, and (z) all other terms and
conditions of the Contract shall remain applicable.
(ii) If a Team exercises a Two-Way Player Conversion Option
pursuant to a Contract with an Exhibit 10, such Contract
shall be considered a Two-Way Contract for the purposes of
this Agreement and subject to all applicable Two-Way
Contract rules herein (including, but not limited to, theStandard NBA Contract Conversion Option) except that
such Contract need not contain an Exhibit 1B.
(iii) To effectuate the requirements set forth above, every
Contract with an Exhibit 10 must contain the following
language (and only such language) under the "Two-Way
Player Conversion Option" and "Standard NBA Contract
Conversion Option" headings, respectively:
Two-Way Player Conversion Option: Team shall have
the option to convert this Contract to a Two-Way Contract
("Two-Way Player Conversion Option"); provided,
however, that (a) such option must be exercised prior to the
first day of the NBA Regular Season, and (b) may not be
exercised if it would result in a violation of Article X,
Section 4(d) of the CBA. Team's Two-Way Player
Conversion Option may be exercised by providing written
notice to Player that is either personally delivered to Player
or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified,
registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of
Player or his representative with a copy to the Players
Association and the NBA. If Team exercises the Two-Way
Player Conversion Option, this Contract's Exhibit 1A will
immediately become null and void and of no further force
or effect and the Player's Compensation shall be equal to the
Two-Way Player Salary applicable for such Season. Further,
upon conversion, the Player's right to the Bonus Amount (if
applicable) set forth above pursuant to this Exhibit 10 will
be rescinded and the Player's Contract, notwithstanding the
absence of an Exhibit 2, shall be protected for lack of skill
and injury or illness at an amount equal to the Conversion
Protection Amount in this Exhibit 10. All other terms and
conditions of this Contract shall remain applicable.
Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option: In the
event the Two-Way Player Conversion Option is exercised
by the Team, Team shall thereafter have the option to
convert the Contract to a Standard NBA Contract
("Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option"). Team's
Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may beexercised by providing written notice to Player that is either
personally delivered to Player or his representative or sent
by email or pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail
to the last known address of Player or his representative with
a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If Team
exercises the Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option,
the Base Compensation amount applicable to the Two-Way
Contract as set forth in this Exhibit 10 will immediately
become null and void and of no further force or effect,
Player's Compensation shall be equal to the Player's
applicable Minimum Player Salary for such Season beginning
on the date such option is exercised, and all other terms and
conditions of this Contract, including the Base
Compensation protection set forth in this Exhibit 10, shall
remain applicable.
Section 12. Bonuses.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for Incentive
Compensation for a Season that exceeds twenty percent
(20%) of the Regular Salary called for by the Contract for
such Season;
(ii) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for a signing
bonus that exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the
Compensation (excluding Incentive Compensation) called
for by the Contract (or, in the case of an Extension, in the
extended term of the Extension); and
(iii) No Offer Sheet may provide for a signing bonus that
exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Compensation (excluding
Incentive Compensation) called for by the Offer Sheet.
(b) If a player's Contract provides for a signing bonus and the player is
suspended for the intentional failure or refusal to render the services
required under his Contract, the Team shall be entitled to a return from the
player of an amount equal to the product of the signing bonus multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Regular Season gamesthat the player is suspended as a result of his failure or refusal to render such
services and the denominator of which is the total number of Regular Season
games to be played by the Team during the term of the Contract (excluding
any Option Year). The foregoing shall not limit any other rights or remedies
a Team may have under the Contract or by law.
(c) (i) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the player's
attendance at and participation in an off-season skill and/or
conditioning program that exceeds two (2) weeks in length.
(ii) A Uniform Player Contract that contains a bonus to be paid
as a result of the player's attendance at and participation in
an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill
and/or conditioning program in accordance with
subsection b(i) above may also contain a provision providing
that such bonus will be paid if: (A) the Team elects in writing
to waive the requirement that the player perform the
specified services; (B) the player, in lieu of providing the
specified services, participates in training and/or plays
games with his national team during the off-season; and/or
(C) the player has an injury, illness, or other medical
condition that renders the player unable to participate in
such summer league and/or skill and conditioning program.
If a Contract contains a provision of the type described in
(A) above and the Team exercises its right to waive the
requirement that the player perform the specified services
with respect to one or more off-seasons, the amounts paid
to the player shall continue to be treated as a bonus for the
player's participation in an off-season summer league or
off-season skill and/or conditioning program and shall
continue to be subject to the rules in this Agreement relating
to such bonuses.
(iii) If a Uniform Player Contract contains a bonus to be paid as
a result of the player's attendance at and participation in an
off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill and/or
conditioning program, the Team shall be required to provide
the player with a reasonable opportunity to earn the bonus
by, for example, providing the player with the dates, times,
and location(s) at which the specified services are to beperformed. A Team's failure to comply with this
requirement with respect to any off-season shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver of the requirement that the player
perform the specified services for such off-season.
(d) No Uniform Player Contract may contain a bonus for the player
being on a Team's roster as of a specified date or for a specified duration,
or for the player dressing in uniform for or being eligible to play in a
specified number of games.
(e) If a Player Contract contains Incentive Compensation, a Team and
player shall not be permitted at any time to amend the Contract to modify
the conditions that the player must satisfy in order to earn all or any portion
of such Incentive Compensation.
Section 13. General.
(a) (i) Subject to Section 15 below, any oral or written agreement
between a player and a Team concerning terms and
conditions of employment shall be reduced to writing in the
form of a Uniform Player Contract or an amendment
thereto as soon as practicable. Immediately upon the
consummation of any such oral or written agreement, the
Team shall notify the NBA by email and provide the NBA
with all economic terms of such agreement. Upon its receipt
of an executed Uniform Player Contract, the NBA shall
provide a copy of the same to the Players Association by
email within two (2) business days.
(ii) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) above, neither the NBA,
any Team, nor the Players Association, or any player, shall
contend that any agreement concerning terms and
conditions of employment is binding upon the player or the
Team until a Player Contract embodying such terms and
conditions has been duly executed by the parties. Nothing
herein is intended to affect (A) any authority of the
Commissioner to approve or disapprove Player Contracts,
or (B) the effect of the Commissioner's approval or
disapproval on the validity of such Player Contracts.(iii) A violation of the first sentence of subsection (a)(i) above
may be considered evidence of a violation of Article XIII.
(b) No player shall attend the regular training camp of any Team, or
participate in games or organized practices with the Team at any time, unless
he is a party to a Player Contract then in effect. For purposes of this
Section 13(b), a player shall be considered to be a party to a Player Contract
then in effect if such Contract has been extended in accordance with an
Option permitted by this Agreement.
(c) The only form of Compensation that a Team may pay a player under
his Uniform Player Contract is cash via a check made payable to the player
or via a direct deposit made to the player's bank account. Compensation of
any other kind is prohibited.
(d) No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money,
property, investments, loans, or anything else of value for fees or otherwise
to an agent, attorney, or representative of a player (for or in connection with
such person's representation of such player); nor shall any Player Contract
provide for such payment. No player shall assign or otherwise transfer to
any third party his right to receive Compensation from the Team under his
Uniform Player Contract. Nothing in this subsection (d), however, shall
prevent a Team from sending a player's regular paycheck to a player's agent,
attorney, or representative if so instructed in writing by the player.
(e) Every Uniform Player Contract must provide that for each Season
of such Contract, the player will be paid at least ten percent (10%) of his
Salary for such Season, excluding Likely Bonuses and any portion of the
player's Salary attributable to a trade bonus, in Current Base Compensation
in accordance with the payment schedule provided in Paragraph 3 of the
Contract or in twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the
first of said payments on November 1 of each year covered by the Contract
and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month
until said Compensation is paid in full.
(f) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the payment of any
Compensation earned for a Season prior to the first semi-monthly payment
date that is at least seven (7) days following the completion of the Audit
Report for the Salary Cap Year covering the immediately prior Season.(g) A Team's termination of a Uniform Player Contract by reason of
the player's "lack of skill" (under Paragraph 16(a)(iii) of the Uniform Player
Contract) shall be interpreted to include a termination based on the Team's
determination that, in view of the player's level of skill (in the sole opinion
of the Team), the Compensation paid (or to be paid) to the player is no
longer commensurate with the Team's financial plans or needs. The
foregoing sentence shall not affect any post-termination obligation to pay
Compensation that may result from Compensation protection provisions
included in a Uniform Player Contract.
(h) The following provisions shall govern an agreement (to be set forth
in Exhibit 6 to a Uniform Player Contract) establishing that the player must
report for and submit to a physical examination to be performed by one or
more physician(s) designated by the Team:
(i) The player must report for such physical examination at the
time designated by the Team (which shall be no later than
the third business day following the execution of the
Contract), and must, upon reporting, supply all information
reasonably requested of him, provide complete and truthful
answers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all
examinations and tests requested of him. The determination
of whether the player has passed the physical examination
shall be made by the Team in its sole discretion, exercised in
good faith, in consultation with one or more of the Team's
physicians; and a Team shall have the right to determine in
good faith that a player has failed to pass the physical
examination due to the risk of a future injury, illness, or
other medical condition notwithstanding that the player is
currently able to play. If the player does not pass the physical
examination, the Team shall so notify the player no later than
the sixth business day following the execution of the
Contract.
(ii) The Team's determination that the player has passed the
physical examination shall be a condition precedent to the
validity of the Contract. Accordingly, and without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentence, until such time as a
player has passed the physical examination, the prohibitionsset forth in Section 13(b) above shall continue to apply to
the Team and player.
(iii) A Required Tender or a Qualifying Offer may contain an
Exhibit 6. If a player accepts such a Required Tender or
Qualifying Offer but does not pass the required physical
examination, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall
be deemed to have been withdrawn, which shall have the
consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI,
Section 4, as the case may be.
(i) A player who knows he has an injury, illness, or other medical
condition that renders, or he knows will likely render, him unable to perform
the playing services required under a Player Contract may not validly enter
into such Contract without prior written disclosure of such injury, illness, or
other medical condition to the Team.
(j) Neither the IST Finals Game, Play-In Games, nor a Team's or a
player's performance during any such games, shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether, as a result of his achievement of
agreed-upon benchmarks related to a player's performance as a player or the
Team's performance during a particular Season:
(i) The player has earned a Performance Bonus included in his
Player Contract in accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) above; or
(ii) Any additional conditions or limitations applicable to a
player's Compensation protection in accordance with
Section 4(l)(ii) above have been satisfied.
(k) No Player Contract may provide for (x) one (1) or more
Performance Bonuses in accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) above, or (y) any
additional conditions or limitations applicable to Compensation protection
in accordance with Section 4(l)(ii) above, that are in either or both cases
based in whole or in part on:
(i) The Team's or the player's performance during any In-
Season Tournament games or Play-In Games;(ii) The Team qualifying to participate in any In-Season
Tournament knockout stage game or winning the IST Finals
Game; or
(iii) The Team qualifying to participate in one (1) or more
Play-In Games;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent a Player Contract
from providing for (A) one (1) or more Performance Bonuses in accordance
with Section 3(b)(ii) above, or (B) any additional conditions or limitations
applicable to Compensation protection in accordance with Section 4(l)(ii)
above, that are in either or both cases based in whole or in part on a player's
or Team's performance in all Regular Season games.
Section 14. Void Contracts.
If a Player Contract fails to take effect or becomes void as a result of a
Commissioner disapproval, the player's failure to pass a physical
examination conducted pursuant to Exhibit 6 to such Contract, or the
rescission of a trade conducted pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e), then,
in each such case:
(a) the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the
player as the Team possessed at the time of the execution of the Contract,
including, without limitation, any such rights that the Team possessed
pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(b), Article X, and Article XI;
(b) any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that was outstanding at the
time the Contract was executed shall continue in effect as if the Contract
had not been executed (including if the original deadline for accepting the
Required Tender or Qualifying Offer expired following the execution of the
Contract), but for no fewer than six (6) business days following the
Commissioner's disapproval, the Team's issuance of notice to the player that
he did not pass the physical examination, or the rescission of such trade, as
the case may be; and
(c) in the case of a player who does not pass a physical examination
pursuant to Exhibit 6: (i) the player shall not be permitted to accept such
Required Tender or Qualifying Offer for a period of two (2) business days
following his receipt of notice from the Team that he did not pass his
physical examination, during which period the Team may elect to withdrawthe Required Tender or Qualifying Offer, which shall have the consequences
described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as the case may
be; and (ii) if the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer is not withdrawn by
the Team during this period, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall
thereafter be deemed amended so as to eliminate any Exhibit 6 that may be
contained therein.
Section 15. Moratorium Period.
Except as permitted in the remainder of this Section 15, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, no player and Team may enter into

Option in a Contract with an Exhibit 10 in accordance with
Article II, Section 11(h) above.
