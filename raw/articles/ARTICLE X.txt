Section 2. Term and Timing of Draft Provisions.
An NBA Draft will be held prior to the commencement of each NBA
Season covered by the term of this Agreement and, despite the expiration
of the other terms of this Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIX, prior to
the commencement of the NBA Season immediately following the final
Season covered by the term of this Agreement. Each such Draft will be held
prior to the July 10 preceding the commencement of the NBA Season on a
date to be designated by the Commissioner.
Section 3. Number of Choices.
(a) The NBA Draft shall consist of two (2) rounds, with each round
consisting of the same number of selections as there will be Teams in the
NBA the following Season. Each Team shall be required to exercise any
and all draft selections in its possession during each round of the Draft.
(b) If, pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or the NBA
Constitution and By-Laws, any Team is required to forfeit one or more draft
pick(s) in a particular NBA Draft, the number of players selected in the
applicable round of the Draft will be reduced by the number of such
forfeitures. (Thus, for example, if Team A is required to forfeit the ninth
pick in the first round of the Draft (at a time when there are thirty (30) NBA
Teams), there will only be twenty-nine (29) players selected in the first round
of such Draft.) In the event the forfeiture relates to one or more first round
picks, the Rookie Salary Scale will be adjusted as set forth in Article VIII,
Section 1(b)(ii). Other than as specifically agreed to herein, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement of the
Players Association to any provision of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws.
Section 4. Negotiating Rights to Draft Rookies.
(a) A Team that drafts a player shall, during the period from the date of
such NBA Draft (hereinafter, the "Initial Draft") to the date of the next
Draft (hereinafter, the "Subsequent Draft"), be the only Team with whichsuch player may negotiate or sign a Player Contract, provided that, (i) on or
before the July 15 immediately following the Initial Draft (for a First Round
Pick), (ii) in the two (2) weeks before the September 5 immediately following
the Initial Draft (for a Second Round Pick selected in an NBA Draft prior
to the 2024 NBA Draft), or (iii) on or before the August 5 immediately
following the Initial Draft (for a Second Round Pick selected in the 2024
NBA Draft or any subsequent NBA Draft), such Team has made a Required
Tender to such player. If a Team has made a Required Tender to such a
player and the player has not signed a Player Contract within the period
between the Initial Draft and the Subsequent Draft, the Team that drafted
the player shall lose its exclusive right to negotiate with the player and the
player will then be eligible for selection in the Subsequent Draft.
(b) A Team that, in the Subsequent Draft, drafts a player who (i) was
drafted in the Initial Draft, (ii) received a Required Tender from the Team
that drafted him in the Initial Draft, and (iii) did not sign a Player Contract
with such first Team prior to the Subsequent Draft, shall, during the period
from the date of the Subsequent Draft to the date of the next NBA Draft,
be the only Team with which such player may negotiate or sign a Player
Contract, provided such Team has made a Required Tender to such player
by the applicable date specified in Section 4(a) above. If such player has not
signed a Player Contract within the period between the Subsequent Draft
and the next NBA Draft with the Team that drafted him in the Subsequent
Draft, that Team shall lose its exclusive right, which it obtained in the
Subsequent Draft, to negotiate with the player, and the player will become a
Rookie Free Agent as of the date of the next NBA Draft.
(c) If a player is drafted in an Initial Draft and (i) receives a Required
Tender, (ii) does not sign a Player Contract with a Team prior to the
Subsequent Draft, and (iii) is not drafted by any Team in such Subsequent
Draft, the player will become a Rookie Free Agent immediately upon the
conclusion of the Subsequent Draft.
(d) If a Second Round Pick receives and signs a Required Tender and is
subsequently waived by the Team after signing such Required Tender, then
the Team that made the Required Tender to the player shall have exclusive
rights to negotiate with and sign (or convert) the player to a Two-Way
Contract for the Season covered by the Required Tender.(e) If a player is drafted by a Team in either an Initial or Subsequent
Draft and that Team does not sign such player to a Player Contract or make
a Required Tender to such player, the player will become a Rookie Free
Agent on (i) the July 16 following such Draft (for a First Round Pick), (ii) on
the September 6 following such Draft (for a Second Round Pick selected in
an NBA Draft prior to the 2024 NBA Draft), or (iii) on the August 6
following such Draft (for a Second Round Pick selected in the 2024 NBA
Draft or any subsequent NBA Draft).
(f) A Team may at any time withdraw a Required Tender it has made to
a player, provided that the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. In the
event that a Required Tender is withdrawn, the player shall thereupon
become a Rookie Free Agent.
(g) A Team that holds the exclusive rights to negotiate with and sign a
drafted player may at any time renounce such exclusive rights, except that,
if the Team has made a Required Tender to the player, a renunciation shall
not be permitted during the time the player has to accept the Required
Tender under Article I, Section 1(ddd). In order to renounce its exclusive
rights with respect to a drafted player, a Team shall provide the NBA with
an express, written statement renouncing such exclusive rights. The NBA
shall provide a copy of such statement to the Players Association within
three (3) business days following its receipt thereof.
(h) Subject to the provisions of Article VII, and subject further to
Article II, Section 15, a Team is free at any time beginning immediately
following the conclusion of the NBA Draft to negotiate, and free at any time
after the conclusion of the Moratorium Period to enter into, a Player
Contract with a Draft Rookie who is subject to that Team's exclusive
negotiating rights.
Section 5. Effect of Contracts with Other Professional Teams.
If a player is drafted by a Team in either an Initial or Subsequent Draft
and, during a period in which he may negotiate and sign a Player Contract
with only the Team that drafted him, either (x) is a party to a previously
existing (i) non-NBA professional basketball contract or (ii) player contract
with a professional basketball team or league not in the NBA that, in either
case, covers all or any part of the NBA Season immediately following saidInitial or Subsequent Draft, or (y) signs either such a player contract (either
(x) or (y), a "Non-NBA Signing"), then the following rules will apply:
(a) Subject to Section 5(b) below, the Team that drafts the player shall
retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign him for the period
ending one (1) year from the earlier of the following two dates: (i) the date
the player notifies such Team that he is available to sign a Player Contract
with such Team immediately, provided that such notice will not be effective
until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign
and play with such Team for the then-current Season (if applicable) and any
future Season; or (ii) the date of the NBA Draft occurring in the
twelve-month period from August 1 to July 30 in which the player notifies
such Team of his availability and intention to play in the NBA during the
Season immediately following said twelve-month period, provided that such
notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other
legal impediment to sign and play with such Team for the then-current
Season (if applicable) and any future Season.
(b) (i) If, by July 1, 2023, the player notifies the Team that has
drafted him that by September 1, 2023 he will, immediately
thereafter and for any future Season, be under no contractual
or other legal impediment to sign and play with such Team,
and provided that on September 1, 2023 the player is in fact
under no such contractual or other legal impediment, then,
in order to retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with
and sign the player as provided in Section 5(a), such Team
must make a Required Tender to the player by September
10, 2023.
(ii) If, by July 1 of any year following 2023, the player notifies
the Team that has drafted him that by August 1 of such year
he will, immediately thereafter and for any future Season, be
under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign and
play with such Team, and provided that on such August 1
the player is in fact under no such contractual or other legal
impediment, then, in order to retain the exclusive NBA
rights to negotiate with and sign the player as provided in
Section 5(a), such Team must make a Required Tender to
the player by August 10 of such year.(c) If the player gives the required notice by July 1 of any year, and the
Team that drafted him fails to make a Required Tender by September 10 of
such year (if such notice was provided by July 1, 2023) or August 10 of such
year (if such notice was provided by July 1 of any year following 2023), the
player shall thereupon become a Rookie Free Agent.
(d) If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights
set forth in Section 5(a) above, the player signs a non-NBA professional
basketball contract or a player contract with a professional basketball team
or league not in the NBA and the player has not made a bona fide effort to
negotiate a Player Contract with the Team possessing his exclusive NBA
rights or such bona fide effort is made and such Team makes a Required
Tender to such player in accordance with Section 5(b) above, then such
Team shall retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign the
player for additional one-year periods as measured in and in accordance with
the provisions of Section 5(a) above.
(e) If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights
set forth in subsection (a) above, (i) the player signs (x) a non-NBA
professional basketball contract or (y) a player contract with a professional
basketball team or league not in the NBA, (ii) the player has made a bona
fide effort to negotiate a Player Contract with the Team possessing his
exclusive NBA rights, and (iii) such Team fails to make a Required Tender
to such player in accordance with Section 5(b) above, then the player shall
thereupon become a Rookie Free Agent.
(f) If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights
set forth in Section 5(a) above, the Team makes or has made a Required
Tender to the player and the player does not sign (x) a non-NBA
professional basketball contract or (y) a player contract with a professional
basketball team or league not in the NBA, then (i) in the case of a player
who was previously drafted in an Initial Draft, the next NBA Draft following
such one-year period shall be deemed the Subsequent Draft as to such
player, and the rules applicable to a player who is subject to a Subsequent
Draft will apply, or (ii) in the case of a player who was previously drafted in
a Subsequent Draft, such player shall become a Rookie Free Agent at the
end of such one-year period.
(g) Notice under this Section 5 shall be provided in writing by email,
personal delivery, or pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail sent tothe Team's principal address or principal office (as then listed in the NBA's
records), to the attention of the Team's general manager and to the League
Office (attention: General Counsel).
Section 6. Application to "Early Entry" Players.
If a player who is eligible for the Draft pursuant to Section 1(b)(ii)(G)
above (an "Early Entry" player) is selected in such Draft by a Team, the
following rules apply:
(a) Subject to Section 5 above, if the player does not thereafter play
intercollegiate basketball, then the Team that drafted him shall, during the
period from the date of such Draft to the date of the Draft in which the
player would, absent his becoming an Early Entry player, first have been
eligible to be selected, be the only Team with which the player may negotiate
or sign a Player Contract, provided that such Team makes a Required
Tender to the player each year by the date specified in Section 4(a) above.
For purposes hereof, the Draft in which such player would, absent his
becoming an Early Entry player, first have been eligible to be selected, will
be deemed the "Subsequent Draft" as to that player, and the rules applicable
to a player who has been drafted in a Subsequent Draft will apply. If the
player, having been selected in a Draft for which he was eligible as an Early
Entry player, has not signed a Player Contract with the Team that drafted
him in such Draft following a Required Tender by that Team and is not
drafted in the Subsequent Draft (as defined in the previous sentence), he
shall become a Rookie Free Agent.
(b) Subject to Section 5 above, if the player does thereafter play
intercollegiate basketball, then the Team that drafted him shall retain the
exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign the player for the period
ending one (1) year from the date of the Draft in which the player would,
absent his becoming an Early Entry player, first have been eligible to be
selected, provided that such Team makes a Required Tender to the player
each year by the date specified in Section 4(a) above. For purposes hereof,
the Draft in which such player would, absent his becoming an Early Entry
player, first have been eligible to be selected, will be deemed the "Initial
Draft" as to that player. The next NBA Draft shall be deemed the
"Subsequent Draft" as to that player, and the rules applicable to a player
who has been drafted in a Subsequent Draft will apply.(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6 or in
Section 5 above, a Non-NBA Signing by an Early Entry player shall never
shorten the period of time during which such player may negotiate and sign
a Player Contract only with the Team that drafted him.
Section 7. Assignment of Draft Rights and Effect of Void
Contracts.
(a) In the event that the exclusive right to negotiate with a player
obtained in any NBA Draft is assigned by a Team to another Team, in
accordance with NBA procedures, the Team to which such right has been
assigned shall have the same, but no greater, right to negotiate with and sign
such player as is possessed by the Team assigning such right, and such player
shall have the same, but no greater, obligation to the Team to which such
right has been assigned as he had to the Team assigning such right.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7(a) above, in
the event that:
(i) Pursuant to Section 4 or 5 above, a Team must make a
Required Tender to a player in order to retain the exclusive
right to negotiate with and sign such player to a Player
Contract, but has not yet made such Required Tender; and
(ii) On or before the applicable date set forth in Section 4(a) or
5(b) above, such Team engages in a trade conference call
pursuant to which the Team assigns, subject to any
applicable trade conditions, the exclusive right to another
Team; then:
(A) if the trade is consummated, the Team to which such rights are assigned
shall have the exclusive right to negotiate with and sign such player to a
Player Contract, provided that such assignee Team makes a Required Tender
to such player on or before the later of (1) the applicable date set forth in
Section 4(a) or 5(b) above, and (2) the date that is three (3) days following
the date on which the trade is consummated (i.e., the date that all conditions
(if any) to the trade are satisfied); or
(B) if the trade is voided (e.g., due to the failure of a condition of a trade),
the assignor Team shall retain the exclusive right to negotiate with and sign
such player to a Player Contract, provided that such Team makes a RequiredTender to such player on or before the later of (1) the applicable date set
forth in Section 4(a) or 5(b) above, and (2) the date that is three (3) days
following the date on which the trade is voided.
(c) In the event that:
(i) Pursuant to Section 4 or 5 above, a Team must make a
Required Tender to a player in order to retain the exclusive
right to negotiate with and sign such player to a Player
Contract, but has not yet made such Required Tender;
(ii) such Team signs such player to a Player Contract prior to
the applicable date set forth in Section 4(a) or 5(b) above;
and
(iii) such Contract becomes void as a result of a Commissioner
disapproval;
then such Team shall have the exclusive right to negotiate with and sign such
player to a Player Contract, provided that it makes a Required Tender to
such player on or before the later of (A) the applicable date set forth in
Section 4(a) or 5(b) above, and (B) the date that is three (3) days following
the date of the Commissioner's disapproval.
Section 8. General.
(a) The placement of a Rookie on the Armed Services List, or on any
of the other lists described in the NBA By-Laws, or on any other list created
by the NBA, shall not extend the period of exclusive negotiating rights
which a Team has to any Draft Rookie beyond the period specified in this
Agreement.
(b) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the NBA, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws, from
prohibiting or otherwise responding to violations by Teams of the exclusive
NBA rights obtained in any NBA Draft, as set forth or referred to in this
Article. Other than as specifically agreed to herein, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement by the Players
Association to any provision of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws.(c) An Early Entry player who is eligible to be selected in the next NBA
Draft pursuant to Section 1(b)(ii)(G) above shall be entitled to withdraw
from such Draft by providing written notice that is received by the NBA ten
(10) days prior to such Draft. A player shall not be entitled to withdraw
from more than two (2) NBA Drafts.
(d) Any claim by a player that a Contract offered as a Required Tender
pursuant to this Article X fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a
Required Tender shall be made by written notice to the Team (with copies
sent to the NBA and the Players Association), no later than ten (10) days
after the receipt of such Contract by the Players Association. Such notice
must set forth the specific changes that the player asserts must be made to
the offered Contract in order for it to constitute a Required Tender. Upon
receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary to satisfy the
requirements of a Required Tender, the Team may, within five (5) business
days, offer the player an amended Contract incorporating the requested
changes. If the Team offers such an amended Contract, the player and the
Players Association shall be precluded from asserting that such Contract
does not constitute a timely and valid Required Tender.
(e) For purposes of this Article X, any rights afforded to "a Team that
drafts a player" shall also be afforded to any Team to which such rights are
subsequently assigned.
Section 9. NBA Draft Combine.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any player
invited by the NBA to attend the Draft Combine who is reasonably
determined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association to have
failed to fulfill his obligation to fully participate in the Draft Combine in
accordance with Article XXII, Section 14 shall be ineligible for selection in
the NBA Draft immediately following such Draft Combine.
(b) If a player is ineligible for selection in a Draft pursuant to
Section 9(a) above and such player is:
(i) an Early Entry player, then he will be deemed to have
withdrawn from such Draft in accordance with Section 8(c)
above (even if such player had previously withdrawn, or hadpreviously been deemed to have withdrawn, from two (2) or
more NBA Drafts); or
(ii) not an Early Entry player, then he will be deemed to meet
the criteria set forth in Section 1(b) or Section 4(a) above, as
applicable, in respect of the Draft immediately following
such Draft.
For clarity, (x) consistent with Section 1(a) above, any player ineligible for
selection in a Draft pursuant to Section 9(a) above may not sign a Contract
or play in the NBA at any time following such Draft until he has been eligible
for selection in at least one (1) NBA Draft following the Draft for which the
player was ineligible for selection pursuant to Section 9(a) above, and (y) any
player ineligible for selection in a Draft pursuant to Section 9(a) above shall
remain subject to the provisions of Article XXII, Section 14, and Section
9(a) above, in respect of any future Draft Combine in which the player is
invited by the NBA to participate following the Draft for which the player
was ineligible for selection pursuant to Section 9(a) above.
Section 10. Combine-Related Eligibility Disputes.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
procedures set forth in this Section 10 shall apply to the resolution of a
dispute regarding a determination by the NBA, in accordance with
Section 9(a) above, that a player invited by the NBA to attend the Draft
Combine has failed to fulfill his obligation to fully participate in the Draft
Combine in accordance with Article XXII, Section 14 and therefore is
ineligible for selection in the NBA Draft immediately following such Draft
Combine (any such dispute, a "Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute"). If in
connection with any such Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute, there is any
conflict between the procedures set forth in this Section 10 and those set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Section
shall control.
(b) Any Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute may be initiated, as set
forth below, only by the Players Association, except that the Players
Association may not initiate a Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute without
the approval of the player concerned. Combine-Related Eligibility Disputes
shall be heard by the System Arbitrator.(c) Any determination that a player is ineligible for selection in an NBA
Draft in accordance with Section 9(a) above must be made no later than the
day that is ten (10) days prior to the date of such Draft.
(d) A Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute must be brought by the
Players Association within two (2) days of the date of the eligibility
determination by the NBA. The Players Association may initiate a
Combine-Related Eligibility Dispute by serving a written notice thereof on
the NBA, with a copy of such written notice to be filed with the System
Arbitrator. Such written notice shall be accompanied by a witness list,
relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on which the Players
Association intends to rely in its affirmative case. No later than the second
day following the date on which the NBA received written notice of the
Dispute, the NBA shall provide to the Players Association a witness list,
relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on which the NBA
intends to rely in its affirmative case. Absent a showing of good cause,
neither the Players Association nor the NBA may proffer, refer to, or rely
on the testimony of any witness, document, or other evidentiary material in
its affirmative case that has not been identified to the other side as required
by this Section 10(d).
(e) The System Arbitrator shall convene a hearing within three (3) days
of the System Arbitrator's receipt of the NBA's submission of its witness
list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials. The hearing shall
take place by videoconference and shall last no longer than one (1) day. The
Players Association and the NBA shall each have the right to participate in
the hearing. The player whose eligibility is the subject of the proceeding
shall have the right to attend the hearing.
(f) The System Arbitrator shall render a decision within one (1) day
following the date of the hearing, and the decision shall be accompanied by
a written opinion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the System Arbitrator
determines that expedition so requires, he/she shall accompany the decision
with a written summary of the grounds upon which the decision is based,
and a full written opinion may follow within a reasonable time thereafter.
The decision of the System Arbitrator shall constitute full, final, and
complete disposition of the dispute and shall be binding upon the parties to
this Agreement and the player, and there shall be no appeal to the Appeals
Panel.(g) If the Players Association prevails in the proceeding, the sole remedy
shall be that the player is deemed eligible for the Draft in respect of which
the dispute was brought.
(h) For clarity, any ongoing dispute regarding a player's Draft eligibility
shall not affect the NBA's scheduling or operation of, or right to hold, the
Draft.
(i) Should circumstances warrant, each of the deadlines set forth in this
Section 10 may be reasonably modified by agreement of the NBA and
Players Association.
