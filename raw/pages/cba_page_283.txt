                                                          Article VII     261
        (2) The tax amounts remitted to the NBA by NBA Teams
        pursuant to Section 12(f) above for each Salary Cap Year shall be
        used and/or distributed as follows:
        (i)     the NBA may elect to distribute up to fifty percent (50%)
                of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams based in whole
                or in part on the fact that such Team(s) did not owe a tax
                for such Salary Cap Year (e.g., the NBA could elect to
                distribute fifty percent (50%) of such amounts in equal
                shares to all non-taxpayers in such Salary Cap Year); and
        (ii)    amounts not distributed in accordance with Section
                12(g)(2)(i) above shall be used for one (1) or more “League
                purposes” (as defined in Section 12(g)(3) below) selected
                by the NBA.
        (3) For purposes of this Section 12(g), the use of Escrow
        Amounts or tax amounts for a “League purpose” shall mean the
        use of such amounts for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
        the distribution of such amounts to one (1) or more Teams;
        provided, however, that such amounts may not be distributed to a
        Team or expended for the benefit or detriment of a Team in a
        manner that is based, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on
        the amount of the Team’s Team Salary or on whether the Team is
        a taxpayer. Without limiting the foregoing, a team assistance plan
        adopted by the NBA and funded, in whole or in part, with Escrow
        Amounts and/or tax amounts shall be considered a “League
        purpose” if, pursuant to the plan, a Team’s entitlement to an
        assistance receipt and/or the amount of such receipt is based, in
        whole or in part, on a profit, loss, and/or expense computation
        determined by the NBA under which the Team is credited with a
        Team Salary no less than the league average; provided, however,
        that in order to qualify as a “League purpose,” such a plan may not
        otherwise base a Team’s entitlement to assistance and/or the
        amount of such assistance on the amount of a Team’s Team Salary
        or on whether the Team is a taxpayer.
   (h) Revenue Decline. If BRI for any Salary Cap Year substantially
decreases from the prior Salary Cap Year’s BRI, and, as a result, the players
receive more than the Designated Share (as defined in Section 12(b)(3)
