conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may
be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not
such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.
   (d) Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 and
is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the
NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section
11(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this
Section 12.
   (e) In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year

not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing
services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free
