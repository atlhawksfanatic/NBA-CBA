                                                          Article XIII   307
                               ARTICLE XIII
                           CIRCUMVENTION
Section 1.     General Prohibitions.
   (a) It is the intention of the parties that the provisions agreed to
herein, including, without limitation, those relating to the Salary Cap, the
Exceptions to the Salary Cap, the scope of Basketball Related Income, the
Escrow and Tax Arrangement, the Rookie Scale, the Right of First Refusal,
the Maximum Player Salary, and free agency, be interpreted so as to
preserve the essential benefits achieved by both parties to this Agreement.
Neither the Players Association, the NBA, nor any Team (or Team
Affiliate) or player (or person or entity acting with authority on behalf of
such player), shall enter into any agreement, including, without limitation,
any Player Contract (including any Renegotiation, Extension, or
amendment of a Player Contract), or undertake any action or transaction,
including, without limitation, the assignment or termination of a Player
Contract, which is, or which includes any term that is, designed to serve
the purpose of defeating or circumventing the intention of the parties as
reflected by all of the provisions of this Agreement.
   (b) It shall constitute a violation of Section 1(a) above for a Team (or
Team Affiliate) to enter into an agreement or understanding with any
sponsor or business partner or third-party under which such sponsor,
business partner or third-party pays or agrees to pay compensation for
basketball services (even if such compensation is ostensibly designated as
being for non-basketball services) to a player under Contract to the Team.
Such an agreement with a sponsor or business partner or third-party may
be inferred where: (i) such compensation from the sponsor or business
partner or third-party is substantially in excess of the fair market value of
any services to be rendered by the player for such sponsor or business
partner or third-party; and (ii) the Compensation in the Player Contract
between the player and the Team is substantially below the fair market
value of such Contract.
   (c) It shall constitute a violation of Section 1(a) above for a Team (or
Team Affiliate) to have a financial arrangement with or offer a financial
inducement to any player (not including retired players) not signed to a
current Player Contract, except as permitted by this Agreement.
