               Amount (if applicable) set forth above pursuant to this
               Exhibit 10 will be rescinded and the Player’s Contract,
               notwithstanding the absence of an Exhibit 2, shall be
               protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at an amount

               Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option: In the
               event the Two-Way Player Conversion Option is exercised
               by the Team, Team shall thereafter have the option to
               convert the Contract to a Standard NBA Contract
               (“Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option”). Team’s
               Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may be
               exercised by providing written notice to Player that is either
               personally delivered to Player or his representative or sent

               to the last known address of Player or his representative
               with a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If
               Team exercises the Standard NBA Contract Conversion
               Option, the Base Compensation amount applicable to the
               Two-Way Contract as set forth in this Exhibit 10 will
               immediately become null and void and of no further force
               or effect, Player’s Compensation shall be equal to the
               Player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for such Season
               beginning on the date such option is exercised, and all
               other terms and conditions of this Contract, including the
               Base Compensation protection set forth in this Exhibit 10,
               shall remain applicable.
