Section 9.    Steroids and Performance-Enhancing Drugs Program.
   (a) Treatment.
         (i)    A player who enters the SPED Program shall be required
                to submit to an evaluation by the SPED Medical Director,
                provide (or cause to be provided) to the SPED Medical
                Director such relevant medical and treatment records as
                the SPED Medical Director may request, and commence
                the treatment and testing program prescribed by the SPED
                Medical Director. Such program may include random
                testing for SPEDs and Diuretics and such non-testing
                elements as may be determined in the professional
                judgment of the SPED Medical Director.
         (ii)   If a player, within five (5) days of the date on which he was
                notified that he had entered the SPED Program and
                without a reasonable excuse, fails to comply (in the
                professional judgment of the SPED Medical Director) with
                any of the obligations set forth in the first sentence of
                Section 9(a)(i) above, he shall be fined $10,000; if the
                player, without a reasonable excuse, thereafter fails to
                comply with such obligations (in the professional judgment
                of the SPED Medical Director) within eight (8) days of
                such notification, he shall be fined an additional $10,000;
                and for each additional day beyond the 8th day that the
                player, without a reasonable excuse, fails to comply with
                such obligations (in the professional judgment of the
                SPED Medical Director), he shall be fined an additional
                $10,000. The total amount of such fines shall not exceed
                the playerâ€™s total Compensation.
   (b) Penalties. Any player who (i) tests positive for a SPED pursuant
to Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing), Section 6 (Random Testing), or
Section 15 (Additional Bases for Testing), or (ii) is adjudged by the
Grievance Arbitrator pursuant to Section 5(e) above to have used or
possessed a SPED, shall suffer the following penalties:
                (A)      For the first such violation, the player shall be
                         suspended for twenty -five (25) games and required
                         to enter the SPED Program;
