114      Article IV
   (c) (1) The “Current Retiree Group” shall mean those former players
         whose last day on an NBA Active List or Inactive List during a
         Regular Season occurred before the 2016-17 Season.
         (2) The “Current Player Group” shall mean those players whose
         last day on an NBA Active List or Inactive List during a Regular
         Season will occur during or after the 2016-17 Season.
   (d) If a player who is included in the Current Retiree Group for one or
more Salary Cap Years returns to an NBA Active List or Inactive List and
thereby moves to the Current Player Group in a later Salary Cap Year, the
Benefit Exclusion Amount for the Salary Cap Year during which he
returns to an NBA Active List or Inactive List shall be reduced by the
amount of the portion of the Benefit Exclusion Amount for the prior
Salary Cap Year(s) that is attributable to such player.
   (e) If the NBA and Players Association provide an alternative
arrangement to any benefit referenced in Sections 10(b)(1) through
10(b)(7) above, the amount to be included in the calculation of the Benefit
Exclusion Amount with regard to that alternative arrangement shall not
exceed the amount referenced in the applicable part of Section 10(b) with
regard to the benefit being replaced by that alternative arrangement for the
most recent Salary Cap Year before such benefit was replaced.
   (f) For the avoidance of doubt, other than the Benefit Exclusion
Amount, all amounts paid or to be paid during any Salary Cap Year by the
NBA or the NBA Teams for the benefits described in this Article IV shall
be included for purposes of all calculations called for under this
Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation, for
purposes of (1) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or
Interim Escrow Audit Report, and (2) calculating Total Benefits, Total
Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits).
