void and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions of
paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract). Such dismissal and
disqualification shall be mandatory and may not be rescinded or reduced
by the player’s Team or the NBA.
   (b) In addition to any other provision of this Agreement requiring that
a player be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA
or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a)
above, a player will also be dismissed and disqualified under Section 11(a)
above if he is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo

Prohibited Substance other than marijuana or a felony involving the

Section 12. Reinstatement.
   (a) After a period of at least two (2) years from the time of a player’s
dismissal and disqualification under Section 11(a) above, and after a period
of at least one (1) year from the date of a First-Year Player’s dismissal and
disqualification under Section 6(b) above, such player may apply for
reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no
right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall
be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players
Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of
the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole
discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable.
Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players
Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without
limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player’s dismissal and
disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment
and rehabilitation program; the player’s conduct since his dismissal,
including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a
suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess
the requisite qualities of good character and morality.
   (b) For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will
consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the
opinion of the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as
applicable), successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or
aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director or the SPED Medical
