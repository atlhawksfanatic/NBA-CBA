34        Article II
    (e) Nothing in this Section 6 shall alter the respective rights and
liabilities of a player and a Team, as provided for in the Uniform Player
Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the termination of a Player
Contract.
    (f) Every Contract entered into between a player and Team that is
intended to provide for Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary
(with no bonuses of any kind) for each Season must contain the following
sentence in Exhibit 1A of such Contract and shall be deemed amended in
the manner described in such sentence: “This Contract is intended to
provide for a Base Compensation for the ____________ Season(s) equal
to the Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s) (with no bonuses of any
kind) and shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to so provide.”
The reference in the preceding sentence to “no bonuses of any kind” shall

Advance Limit for a Season shall equal the lesser of (i) eighty percent
(80%) of the amount of the player’s Compensation for such Season that is

deducted in full from the first installment of Current Base Compensation
(i.e., on November 15) and, if necessary after reducing in full the first
installment, the second installment of Current Base Compensation (i.e., on
