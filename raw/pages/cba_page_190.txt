            beginning with the second Salary Cap Year prior to the

            any Zero Year (as defined in Section 3(a)(2)(vi) below))
            shall, on such July 1, be aggregated and attributed in equal

            his Prior Team covering four (4) or fewer Seasons entered

            Section 3(a)(2)(iv), a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who
            (x) enters into an Over 38 Contract with his Prior Team
            prior to October 1 of a Salary Cap Year, (y) is age 34 at the
