    (6) Any amounts that the Escrow Agent is obligated to disburse
    to a player pursuant to this Section 12, including the amounts
    described in Section 12(d)(4)(iv) above, shall be reduced by all
    amounts required to be withheld by federal, state, and local
    authorities, which withholdings shall be disbursed by the Escrow
    Agent to the player’s Team for remittance to the appropriate
    authorities. To assist the Escrow Agent in disbursing the
    appropriate amounts to each Adjustment Player and his respective
    Team, each Team, based on the information set forth in paragraph
    2 and paragraph 4 of the Notice to the NBA and the Players
    Association, shall promptly provide the Escrow Agent with a
    schedule for each of its Adjustment Players showing the exact
    withholding amount to be disbursed to the Team for remittance to
    the appropriate federal, state and local authorities. In no
    circumstance shall the employer’s share of FICA, FUTA, or any
    other employer taxes be paid out of the amounts deposited in
    escrow or any interest or earnings thereon. Any such obligations
    shall remain with each player’s individual employer.
