              term) in proportion to the percentage of Base
              Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the
              time of allocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the
              event that, at the time of allocation, none of the then-
              current or applicable remaining Base Compensation is
              protected for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the
              signing bonus shall be allocated to the Salary Cap Year
              during which the player’s extended Contract is traded.
  (c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan
made by any Team to a player:
      (1) If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an
      effective rate lower than the “Target Rate” (as defined below)),
      then the interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a
      rate equal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual
      rate of interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest
      shall be included in the player’s Salary. The “Target Rate” means
      the “Prime Rate” (as defined below) plus one percent (1%) as of
      the date the loan is agreed upon, except that the “Target Rate”
      shall be no lower than seven percent (7%) or greater than nine
      percent (9%). For purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), “Prime Rate”
      means the prime rate reported in the “Money Rates” column or
      any successor column of The Wall Street Journal.
      (2) No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding
      loans to the player) exceed the amount of the player’s Salary for the
      then-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill. All
      loans must be repaid through deductions from the player’s
      remaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the
      Contract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for Base
      Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior to the
      Effective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the
      “annual allocable repayment amounts”). If a loan is made at a time
      when the remaining Current Base Compensation due for the
      relevant Season that is fully protected for lack of skill is less than
      the annual allocable repayment amount that would be owed on a
      loan for the full amount of the player’s Current Base
      Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill for the
      relevant Season (the “maximum annual allocable repayment
