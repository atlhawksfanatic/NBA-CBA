     (i)   During or in connection with any NBADL Work
           Assignment or D-League Two-Way Service, a player (A)
           shall continue to receive the Compensation called for by
           his Uniform Player Contract, and (B) shall not receive (or
           accept) any compensation of any kind from the NBADL or
           any NBADL team other than as expressly set forth in this
           Article XLI. The playerâ€™s performance in the NBADL
           shall not be considered for purposes of any Incentive
           Compensation contained in his Uniform Player Contract.

           sustained while participating in a basketball practice or

           Assignment, a player (A) shall continue to be eligible to
           receive the benefits set forth in Article IV of this
           Agreement to the extent that such player would have been
           eligible to receive such benefits under this Agreement
           absent the NBADL Work Assignment, and (B) shall not be
           eligible to receive (and shall not accept) any benefits from
           the NBADL or any NBADL team, unless expressly set
           forth in this Article XLI.
     (iv)  To the extent necessary, any plans and/or policies
           described in Article IV of this Agreement shall be amended
           to implement the provisions of Section 4(b)(iii) of this
           Article.
