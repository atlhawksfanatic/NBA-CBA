80       Article IV
         Contributions being fully deductible under the Code (and, where
         applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the 401(k)
         Plan. If, for any reason, all or a portion of the Salary Deferral
         Contributions, Matching Contributions and/or Two-Way
         Matching Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan will not,
         when paid to the 401(k) Plan, be fully deductible under the Code,
         the NBA and the Players Association agree that the contributions
         shall be reduced to result in all such contributions being fully
         deductible when paid.
   (e) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the 401(k) Plan
shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a tax-effective
basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that a player
shall not be eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan for the period of time
during which the player is a Canadian Resident but shall instead be eligible
to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below. If the NBA
and the Players Association should determine that the 401(k) Plan cannot
continue to be provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under
Canadian federal income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree
to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be
provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. The costs of any such
alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an
after-tax basis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the
annual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with
respect to the Matching Contributions for the Toronto Players. The cost
to Toronto of providing for any such alternative arrangement: (1) shall be
applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below,
and (2) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any,
that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below. If
despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail
to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above,
such failure to agree shall not create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement
during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of
401(k) benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
   (f) 401(k) Plan Tax-Qualification Status.                      Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to
the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether
final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any
interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,
