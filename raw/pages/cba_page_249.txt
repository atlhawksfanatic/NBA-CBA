(d) (i)   No Draft Rookie who signs a Standard NBA Contract or
          player who signs a Two-Way Contract may be traded
          before thirty (30) days following the date on which the
          Contract is signed.
    (ii)  No player who signs a Contract as a Free Agent (or who
          signs a Standard NBA Contract while under a Two-Way
          Contract) may be traded before the later of (A) three (3)
          months following the date on which such Contract was
          signed or (B) the December 15 of the Salary Cap Year in
          which such Contract was signed; provided, that if a
          Contract is signed in connection with an agreement to
          trade the Contract in accordance with Section 8(e) below,
          the foregoing rule shall not apply to the initial trade but
          shall instead be applicable if the Contract is traded a second
          time. For the purposes of this rule, a Two-Way Contract
          that is converted to a Standard NBA Contract pursuant to
          such Contract’s Standard NBA Contract Conversion
          Option will be deemed to be signed at the date of the
          conversion.

          Veteran Free Agent who, in accordance with Section
          6(b)(1) or (3) above, enters into a new Player Contract with
          his prior Team that provides for a Salary for the first
          Season of such new Contract greater than one hundred
          twenty percent (120%) of the Salary for the last Season of
          the player’s immediately prior Contract. The rule set forth
          in this Section (d)(iii) shall not apply to a player if his new
          Contract provides for Salary equal to the Minimum Player
