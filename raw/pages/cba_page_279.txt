                                                       Article VII    257
(e) Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfalls.
    (1) If, with respect to any Salary Cap Year, there is an Aggregate
    Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall, then the Contract
    (other than a Two-Way Contract) of each of the following Salary
    Cap Year’s Adjustment Players shall be amended by operation of
    this Agreement, in accordance with Section 12(e)(2) below, such
    that the aggregate Compensation paid to all such players with
    respect to the Season covered by such following Salary Cap Year
    shall be reduced by the Aggregate Compensation Adjustment
    Amount Shortfall, which reduction shall be in addition to the full
    amount of any reduction for such following Salary Cap Year called
    for in Section 12(b)(1)-(2) above.
    (2) The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each
    Adjustment Player whose Contract is amended in accordance with
    Section 12(e)(1) above shall be calculated by multiplying the
    Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount Shortfall for the
    prior Salary Cap Year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
    player’s then-current Salary, and the denominator of which is the
    sum of all such players’ then-current Salaries. For purposes of
    calculating the fraction described in the preceding sentence, (i) the
    Salary of a player making the Minimum Player Salary shall include
    the portion of such Minimum Player Salary that is reimbursed out
    of the League-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section
    6(g)(2); and (ii) the Salary of a player under a Rookie Scale Contract
    whose Compensation under his Contract is increased pursuant to
    Article VIII, Section 5 shall include the portion of his
    Compensation attributable to the Rookie Scale Conforming
    Increases (as described in Article VIII, Section 5(a)) that is
    reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in
    Article IV, Section 6(g)(4).
    (3) The Individual Shortfall Adjustment Amount for each
    Adjustment Player shall be deducted by the player’s Team in four
    (4) equal installments from each of the player’s first four (4) semi-
    monthly payment dates under paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player
    Contract following delivery to the Escrow Agent of the completed
    Notice to the NBA and the Players Association. All such
    deductions shall be promptly remitted by the Teams to the NBA.
