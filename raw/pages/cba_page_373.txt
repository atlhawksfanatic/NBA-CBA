                                                          Article XXII      351
   (c) If the NBA, a Team, or the Players Association has been advised
by a physician that a player is medically unable and/or medically unfit to
perform his duties as a professional basketball player as a result of a
potentially life-threatening injury, illness or other health condition and/or
that performing such duties would create a materially elevated risk of death
for the player, then the NBA, a Team, or the Players Association may refer
the player to a Fitness-to-Play Panel by making such a referral in writing to
the player and to the NBA, Team, and Players Association, as applicable.
Once so referred, the player will not be permitted to play or practice in the
NBA until he is cleared to do so by the Panel as set forth below.
   (d) (1)       Upon the referral described in subsection (c) above, the
                 Panel will be provided with all medical information in the
                 player’s medical file that any member of the Panel deems
                 relevant to the injury, illness or other health condition for
                 which the player was referred. The Panel will review the
                 player’s injury, illness or other health condition (which
                 review shall include an in-person examination of the player
                 by each member of the Panel unless such member
                 determines that an examination by him/her would serve no
                 useful purpose). Upon conclusion of its review, the Panel
                 shall provide a report to the NBA, the player’s Team, and
                 the Players Association setting forth its determination and
                 the reasons therefor.
        (2)      The determination to be made by the Panel is whether, in
                 the panel’s reasonable medical judgment and experience,
                 and having considered current medical knowledge and the
                 best available objective evidence: (i) the player is medically
                 able and medically fit to perform his duties as a
                 professional basketball player; and (ii) performing such
                 duties would not create a materially elevated risk of death
                 for the player. Where there are authoritative medical
                 guidelines on fitness for athletic participation and a
                 particular injury, illness or other health condition (e.g., the
                 American Heart Association/American College of
                 Cardiology Scientific Statements on Eligibility and
                 Disqualification – Recommendations for Competitive
                 Athletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities), the panel will
                 consider such guidelines in making its determination.
