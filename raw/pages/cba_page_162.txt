    Years; provided, however, that no reference may be made to the
    past practice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any
    source or category of revenue or expense that was included on the
    “open issues” list prepared by the Accountants in connection with
    any of such Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past
    practice shall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by
    the terms of this Agreement. In addition, no reference may be
    made, with respect to expenses related to the NBA’s non-
    international business, to the fact that such category of expenses
    falls within Section 1(a)(14) below, to argue for the inclusion or
    exclusion of expenses related to the League’s non-international
    business.
    (4) The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into
    after the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related
    Party) and an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants
    may attribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of
    computing BRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues

    in BRI if received by the Team (or a Related Party) to the following
    extent: in the event of a renewal, extension or renegotiation of a
    lease between the same parties, or a new lease entered into by a
    Team (or a Related Party) with an arena that is not a Related Party,
    the Team will be deemed to receive in the first Salary Cap Year
    covered by the new lease or by the renewal, extension or
    renegotiation of the existing lease (as the case may be) the greater
    of (i) the amount of such revenues that the Team or the Related
    Party in fact receives under the lease or, (ii) if in the opinion of the
    Accountants, the Team (and/or the Related Party) is receiving
    substantially less than fair market value as determined by the
    Accountants (taking into account factors such as the rent paid by
    the Team or the Related Party, the number and identity of other
    major tenants in the arena, market conditions, the extent to which
    arena revenues are used to fund construction or renovations of the
    arena, and comparable lease arrangements in the NBA), an amount
    determined by the Accountants to constitute the fair market value
    of the revenues that a tenant, in the same circumstances as the
    Team or Related Party, would receive for such Salary Cap Year. In
