                                     Article VII     251
    (other than Two-Way Players). Within three (3)
    business days following the date of the last game of
    the NBA Finals occurring during each Salary Cap
    Year, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
    in accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement,
    the aggregate Performance Bonus Escrow
    Amounts for all of its Adjustment Players. Within
    three (3) business days following an Adjustment
    Player’s Trade Bonus Deduction Date, the player’s
    Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in
    accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement, the
    player’s Trade Bonus Escrow Amount.               All
    amounts received by the Escrow Agent shall be
    invested and disbursed in accordance with the
    provisions of the Salary Escrow Agreement. With
    respect to Two-Way Players, within three (3)
    business days of the January 1, March 1 and May 1
    Deduction Dates, each Team shall deliver to the
    Escrow Agent in accordance with the Salary
    Escrow Agreement, the aggregate amount withheld
    from the Compensation of the Team’s Two-Way
    Players for the prior three Deduction Dates and
    current Deduction Date pursuant to Section
    12(c)(2) above.
(B) It is the intention of the NBA and the Players
    Association that the provisions of this Section 12(c)
    result each Salary Cap Year in the delivery to the
    Escrow Agent, with respect to each Adjustment
    Player, of the player’s full Escrow Amount.
    Accordingly, if for any reason the procedures in
    this Section 12(c) would result in less than the full
    Escrow Amount with respect to any Adjustment
    Player being delivered to the Escrow Agent, the
    NBA and the Players Association shall agree on
    such supplemental measures as are necessary to
    effectuate the deduction of the appropriate amount
    from the player’s Compensation for delivery to the
    Escrow Agent.
