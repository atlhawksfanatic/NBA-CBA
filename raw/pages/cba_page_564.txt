evaluation under the supervision of the Policy Committee, to participate in
relevant training, education, or counseling programs as determined by the
Policy Committee, and/or to perform community service. Any discipline
determined by the Commissioner may be referred to the player’s team for
imposition.

discuss the matter. This conference shall be considered confidential, and
