                                                  Article VII   263
(4) (i) For    purposes of the computations made by the
        Accountants pursuant to Section 10 above and this Section
        12, the Salary of a player who is suspended by the NBA –
        but not by a Team – shall be reduced (for the Salary Cap
        Year covering the Season during which the player is
        suspended) by an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of
        the suspension-related Compensation amount that is
        collected from the player and retained by the NBA at the
        time the computations of the Accountants are made.
        Other than as set forth in the preceding sentence, the
        computation of a player’s Salary under this Agreement shall
        be made without regard to any reduction in Compensation
        that results from the player’s suspension by the NBA or his
        Team.
(ii)    When (A) a player has forfeited a portion of his
        Compensation for a Season as a result of a suspension
        imposed by the NBA or his Team and (B) the player’s
        Compensation is later reduced pursuant to Section 12(b)(1)
        and (2) above, the player shall be entitled to a refund of a
        portion of the Compensation forfeited as a result of the
        suspension. The refund shall be in an amount equal to
        (x) the player’s Individual Compensation Adjustment
        Amount for the Salary Cap Year to which the suspension
        related multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
        the amount of the player’s Compensation that was forfeited
        as a result of the suspension and the denominator of which
        is the player’s Base Compensation for such Season as of
        the date(s) he served the suspension, less (y) all amounts
        required to be withheld by federal, state, and local
        authorities. For purposes of the calculation required in
        clause (x) above, a player’s Individual Compensation
        Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to include only the
        portion of the player’s Individual Compensation
        Adjustment Amount that relates to the player’s Base
        Compensation earned under the Player Contract for the
        NBA team that the player was playing for while he was
        suspended. Such refund shall be made to the player within
        sixty (60) days following the Accountants’ submission to
        the NBA and the Players Association of a final Audit
