(iii)   For the avoidance of doubt, (A) in no event shall the value
        of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in
        NBA-related entities be included in BRI, and (B) the value
        of, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in
        non-NBA-related entities shall be included in BRI
