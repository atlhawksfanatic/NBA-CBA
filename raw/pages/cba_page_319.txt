                                                           Article XI     297
receives an Offer Sheet at any time during a Moratorium Period, the
ROFR Team shall have until 11:59 p.m. (ET) on July 8 to give the First
Refusal Exercise Notice.
   (j) After exercising its Right of First Refusal as described in this
Section 5, the ROFR Team may not trade the Restricted Free Agent for
one (1) year, without the player’s consent. Even with the player’s consent,
for one (1) year, neither the ROFR Team exercising its Right of First
Refusal nor any other Team may trade the player to the Team whose Offer
Sheet was matched.
   (k)   (i)    Any Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice
                on the player reporting for and passing, in the sole
                discretion of the Team (exercised in good faith), a physical
                examination to be conducted by a physician designated by
                the Team within two (2) days from its exercise of the Right
                of First Refusal.       In connection with the physical
                examination, the player must supply all information
                reasonably requested of him, provide complete and truthful
                answers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all
                examinations and tests requested of him.
         (ii)   In the event the player does not submit to the requested
                physical examination within two (2) days of the exercise of
                the Right of First Refusal then, until such time as the player
                submits to the requested physical examination and is
                notified of the results, the ROFR Team’s conditional First
                Refusal Exercise Notice shall remain in effect, except that
                the ROFR Team may elect at any time to withdraw its First
                Refusal Exercise Notice, which shall have the effect of
                invalidating the Offer Sheet and causing the Team that
                issued the Offer Sheet to be prohibited from signing or
                acquiring the player for a period of one (1) year from the
                date the First Refusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn. If
                the player does not submit to the requested physical
                examination on or before March 1, the Offer Sheet shall be
                deemed invalid and the Team that issued the Offer Sheet
                shall be prohibited from signing or acquiring the player for
                a period of one (1) year from such March 1.
