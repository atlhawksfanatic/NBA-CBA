                                           Article XXIV         369
     the trade (excluding an Option Year if not yet exercised);
     and (B) in connection with the extension of a Contract that
     contains a trade bonus, the specification of whether the
     trade bonus shall apply to the extended term of the
     Contract in accordance with Section 2(a)(v) below.
(iv) A Contract that does not contain a trade bonus when
     signed cannot be amended to add one, except that: (A) if
     the Contract is extended (other than pursuant to an
     agreement to trade the extended Contract in accordance
     with Article VII, Section 8(e)), the Contract may be
     amended simultaneously to provide for a trade bonus that
     will be payable only the first time that the Contract is
     traded following the signing of the Extension (and not as a
     result of any subsequent trade), and (B) if the Contract is
     extended pursuant to an agreement to trade the extended
     Contract in accordance with Article VII, Section 8(e), the
     Contract may be amended simultaneously to provide for a
     trade bonus that shall not apply to such initial trade but
     shall instead be payable only if the extended Contract is
     traded a second time (and not as a result of a subsequent
     trade).
(v)  If a Contract is extended that contains a trade bonus that
     has not been previously earned, the Contract may be
     amended simultaneously to provide that the trade bonus
     provision will not be applicable to the extended term. In
     order to so provide, the extension must include a
     replacement Exhibit 4 to the Contract with the same terms
     as the original Exhibit 4, but also providing that “The
     foregoing trade bonus shall not be applicable with respect
     to the extended term of this Contract.” To illustrate the
     foregoing, assume that a player and Team agree at the time
     of signing of an extension that the trade bonus contained
     in the original Contract shall not be applicable to the
     extended term. In such case: (y) if the player is first traded
     under the Contract during the remainder of the original
     term of the Contract (i.e., prior to the first year of the
     extended term), then the player’s trade bonus shall be
     calculated based solely on the Base Compensation
