subsequent Salary Cap Years by forty-five percent (45%). (For clarity, the
foregoing 45% increase in Rookie Scale Amounts for the 2019-20 Salary
Cap Year would be applied in both the 2018-19 and 2019-20 Rookie Salary
Scales.)
   (c) For illustrative purposes, an example of the 2018-19 and 2019-20
Rookie Salary Scales assuming five percent (5%) annual growth in the
Salary Cap is annexed hereto as Exhibit B-3.
Section 5.     Existing Rookie Scale Contract Increases.
   (a) In respect of any Rookie Scale Contract in effect as of the effective
date of this Agreement that: (i) was entered into prior to the execution of
this Agreement and is not terminated on or before June 30, 2017; and (ii)
has a term including the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, and/or 2019-20
Season, such Contract shall be deemed amended on July 1, 2017 as
follows: the remaining Base Compensation, Incentive Compensation, and
Base Compensation protection shall be increased: (i) fifteen percent (15%)
in respect of the 2017-18 Season; (y) thirty percent (30%) in respect of the
2018-19 Season; and (z) forty-five percent (45%) in respect of the 2019-20
Season (collectively the “Rookie Scale Conforming Increases”).
   (b) Rookie Scale Conforming Increases shall be paid by the player’s
Team in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the player’s
Contract for each applicable Season (i.e., each payment to the player under
his Contract shall be increased by 15%, 30% or 45%, as applicable), and
then reimbursed to the Team out of a League-wide fund created and
maintained by the NBA.
   (c) As set forth in Article IV, Sections 6(g)(3) and 6(d), Rookie Scale
Conforming Increases and the CBA benefits associated therewith (e.g., the
employer’s share of payroll taxes) will both be included in the calculation
of Benefits (and thus, consistent with Article I, Section 1(www), in the
calculation of Total Salaries and Benefits). However, subject to Section
(d)(ii) below and as set forth in Article VII, Sections 3(j) and 4(a), the
Rookie Scale Conforming Increases shall be excluded from the calculation
of an individual player’s Salary and each Team’s Team Salary (and thus will
not affect, for example, the amount of room, if applicable, a Team has
below the Salary Cap, the amount of Traded Player Exceptions, etc.).
