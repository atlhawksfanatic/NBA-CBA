    amount(s) of the Team’s Exception(s) (excluding the amount of
    the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception unless the Team is no
    longer able to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception
    but remains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception,
    in which case the amount of the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
    Exception shall be included).
    (2) In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual
    Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or the
    Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer
    Mid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer able to use
    the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but remains able to
    use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception) and/or Traded
    Player Exception arises, the Team’s Team Salary is below the
    Salary Cap (or in the event that, prior to the expiration of any such
    Exceptions, the Team’s Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by
    less than the amount of such Exceptions, then (i) the Team’s Team
    Salary shall include, until the Exceptions are actually used or until
    the Team no longer is entitled to use the Exceptions, the amount
    of the Exceptions (or any unused portion of the Exceptions), and
    (ii) the amount by which the Team’s Team Salary is less than the
    Salary Cap shall thereby be extinguished. When the Disabled
    Player Exception is used to sign or acquire a player, the
    Replacement Player’s Salary for the Season covered by his
    Contract, instead of the amount of the Exception, shall be included
    in Team Salary. When a Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-
    Level Salary Exception or Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception is
    used to sign a player, or when a Traded Player Exception is used to
    acquire a player, the Salary for the first Season of the signed or
    acquired Contract plus any then-unused portion of the Exception,
    instead of the full amount of the Exception, shall be included in
    Team Salary. A Team may at any time renounce its rights to use an
    Exception, in which case the Exception (or any unused portion of
    the Exception) will no longer be included in Team Salary.
