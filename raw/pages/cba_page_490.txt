or threatened and whether conventional or other, including, but not
limited to, chemical or biological wars or war-like action); sabotage,
terrorism or threats of sabotage or terrorism; explosions; epidemics;
weather or natural disasters, including, but not limited to, fires, floods,
droughts, hurricanes, tornados, storms or earthquakes; and any
governmental order or action (civil or military); provided, however, that
none of the foregoing enumerated events or conditions is within the
reasonable control of the NBA or an NBA Team.
   (b) In addition to any other rights a Team or the NBA may have by
contract or by law, if a Force Majeure Event occurs and, as a result, one or
more Teams are unable to play one or more games (whether Exhibition,
Regular Season, or Playoff games), then, for each missed Exhibition,
Regular Season, or Playoff game during such period (the “Force Majeure
Period”) that was not rescheduled and replayed, the Compensation payable
to each player who was on the roster of a Team that was unable to play
one or more games during the Force Majeure Period shall be reduced by
1/92.6th of the player’s Compensation for the Season(s) covering the
Force Majeure Period. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, and
notwithstanding the actual number of games that any Team played, was
scheduled to play, or could have played during the Seasons(s) affected by
the Force Majeure Event, each Team shall be deemed to play five (5)
Exhibition games, eighty-two (82) Regular Season games, and 5.6 Playoff
games during each such Season.
   (c) In the event that Section 5(b) above applies, the applicable
Compensation reduction from each player shall be withheld by the player’s
Team from the first Compensation payment (or payments, if the first such
payment is insufficient to satisfy the reduction) that is (or are) due or to
become due to such player following the commencement of the Force
Majeure Period (whether under the Player Contract that was in existence at
the commencement of the Force Majeure Period or any subsequent Player
Contract between the player and the Team). If such Compensation
payment (or payments) is (or are) insufficient to cover the Compensation
reduction required by Section 5(b) above, then either (i) the player shall
promptly pay the difference directly to the Team (“old Team”), or (ii) if he
subsequently enters into a Player Contract with, or is traded to, another
NBA Team (“new Team”), such difference shall be withheld from the first
available Compensation payment (or payments, if the first such payment is
insufficient to satisfy the remaining reduction) that is (or are) due to the
