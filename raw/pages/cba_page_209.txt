    (3) A Team that holds draft rights to a First Round Pick may elect
    to have the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Cap Hold Amount
    excluded from its Team Salary at any time prior to the first day of
    any Regular Season by providing the NBA with a written statement
    that the Team will not sign the player during that Salary Cap Year
    accompanied by a written statement from the First Round Pick
    renouncing his right to accept any outstanding Required Tender
    made to him by the Team. After making such an election, (i) the
    Team shall be prohibited from signing the player during that Salary
    Cap Year, except in accordance with Section 5(e)(4)(ii) below, (ii)
    the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the

    prior to such election, and (iii) the player’s applicable Rookie Scale
    Amount shall be included again in his Team’s Team Salary at the
    applicable Rookie Scale Cap Hold Amount on the following July 1.

    statement renouncing his right to accept that year’s outstanding
    Required Tender, the Player shall no longer be permitted to accept
    it.

    draft rights during the Salary Cap Year immediately following the
    Draft in which he was selected (or during the same Salary Cap Year
    in which he was drafted if the Draft occurs on or after July 1), the
    “applicable Rookie Scale Amount” for such First Round Pick
    means, with respect to any subsequent Salary Cap Year, the Rookie
    Scale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted in the
    Draft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same
    draft position at which he was actually selected.
