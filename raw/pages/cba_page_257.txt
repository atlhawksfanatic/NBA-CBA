                                                           Article VII    235
   (f) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for
a Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues or expenses.
With respect to any such estimated revenues or expenses, the Accountants
shall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Salary
Cap Year (“Subsequent Audit Report”), or the Audit Report for the same
Salary Cap Year in the event that an Interim Audit Report was previously
issued for that Salary Cap Year, determine the actual revenues and
expenses received for the prior Salary Cap Year and include as a credit or
debit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate
difference, if any, between all such estimated revenues and expenses for
the prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues and expenses received
for such Salary Cap Year.
   (g) In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a
Salary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in
computing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous
Salary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or
overstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties
agree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the
resulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an
error (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute
resolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such
understatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted
from BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1)
year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of
the issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit
Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or
overstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current and
subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not include
procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in prior audits.
   (h) In the event that there is an NHL players’ strike or owners’ lockout
(“work stoppage”) resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL
season in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund
being made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders or to
purchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which
both an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the
revenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses and fixed arena signage
and/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds
