276     Article X
in Article VIII, Section 1(b)(ii). Other than as specifically agreed to herein,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement
of the Players Association to any provision of the NBA Constitution and
By-Laws.
Section 4.    Negotiating Rights to Draft Rookies.
   (a) A Team that drafts a player shall, during the period from the date
of such NBA Draft (hereinafter, the “Initial Draft”) to the date of the next
Draft (hereinafter, the “Subsequent Draft”), be the only Team with which
such player may negotiate or sign a Player Contract, provided that, on or
before the July 15 immediately following the Initial Draft (for a First
Round Pick), or in the two (2) weeks before the September 5 immediately
following the Initial Draft (for a Second Round Pick), such Team has
made a Required Tender to such player. If a Team has made a Required
Tender to such a player and the player has not signed a Player Contract
within the period between the Initial Draft and the Subsequent Draft, the
Team that drafted the player shall lose its exclusive right to negotiate with
the player and the player will then be eligible for selection in the
Subsequent Draft.
   (b) A Team that, in the Subsequent Draft, drafts a player who (i) was
drafted in the Initial Draft, (ii) received a Required Tender from the Team
that drafted him in the Initial Draft, and (iii) did not sign a Player Contract
with such first Team prior to the Subsequent Draft, shall, during the
period from the date of the Subsequent Draft to the date of the next NBA
Draft, be the only Team with which such player may negotiate or sign a
Player Contract, provided such Team has made a Required Tender to such
player by the dates specified in Section 4(a) above. If such player has not
signed a Player Contract within the period between the Subsequent Draft
and the next NBA Draft with the Team that drafted him in the Subsequent
Draft, that Team shall lose its exclusive right, which it obtained in the
Subsequent Draft, to negotiate with the player, and the player will become
a Rookie Free Agent as of the date of the next NBA Draft.
   (c) If a player is drafted in an Initial Draft and (i) receives a Required
Tender, (ii) does not sign a Player Contract with a Team prior to the
Subsequent Draft, and (iii) is not drafted by any Team in such Subsequent
Draft, the player will become a Rookie Free Agent immediately upon the
conclusion of the Subsequent Draft.
