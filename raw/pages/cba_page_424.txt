402 Article XXXI
    (5)     If a dispute under Section 9(a)(i)(y) above is not resolved in
            a manner satisfactory to the player as a result of the
            procedures set forth in Section 9(a)(1)-(4) above, then the
            Players Association may (with the approval of such player)
            seek review of the financial impact of the Commissioner’s
            decision by filing a written request for such review with the
            Player Discipline Arbitrator (as provided for below) within
            ten (10) days following the issuance of such decision, and
            the following procedures shall apply:
            (a)      Following receipt of the written request for review,
                     the Player Discipline Arbitrator shall schedule a
                     meeting with the player, the Players Association,
                     and the NBA (and such representatives as each may
                     designate), shall review the relevant facts and
                     circumstances, and shall issue a decision affirming
                     or reducing the financial penalty imposed by the
                     Commissioner. All such meetings shall be in
                     person, shall be held in New York (alternating
                     between the NBA and Players Association offices),
                     and shall be conducted during the month of
                     September following the conclusion of the Season
                     in which the in-game conduct involving another
                     player occurred.
            (b)      In reviewing the fine and/or suspension imposed
                     upon the player by the Commissioner, the Player
                     Discipline Arbitrator shall have authority only to
                     affirm or reduce the financial penalty associated
                     with such fine and/or suspension (including lost
                     salary). The Player Discipline Arbitrator shall have
                     no authority to review financial penalties
                     automatically imposed as a result of technical fouls,
                     ejections, or the violation of other similar NBA
                     rules that result in the imposition of an automatic
                     penalty (such as the “leaving the bench” rule). The
                     review by the Player Discipline Arbitrator shall be
                     de novo.
