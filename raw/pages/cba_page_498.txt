            occurred, such player’s Base Compensation shall be
            reduced by (i) 1/88th of the player’s Two-Way NBADL
            Salary for any suspension of less than twelve (12) games,

            (12) games or more, or consecutive suspensions for

            games or more) (the “D-League Reduction Rate”) for each
            missed NBADL exhibition, regular season or playoff game,
            and such player must be maintained on the Team’s Two-
            Way List for the full term of the suspension; (B) if the
            Two-Way Player was on the Active List when the actions
            that led to the suspension occurred and the player was
            suspended by the NBA, such player’s Base Compensation
            shall be reduced by (i) 1/145th of the player’s Two-Way
            NBA Salary for any suspension of less than twenty (20)
            games, and (ii) 1/110th of the player’s Two-Way NBA
            Salary for any suspension of twenty (20) games or more
