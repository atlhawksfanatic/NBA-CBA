                                                            Article II     61
                Contract), and must, upon reporting, supply all information
                reasonably requested of him, provide complete and truthful
                answers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all
                examinations and tests requested of him.                  The
                determination of whether the player has passed the physical
                examination shall be made by the Team in its sole
                discretion, exercised in good faith, in consultation with one
                or more of the Team’s physicians; and a Team shall have
                the right to determine in good faith that a player has failed
                to pass the physical examination due to the risk of a future
                injury, illness or other health condition notwithstanding
                that the player is currently able to play. If the player does
                not pass the physical examination, the Team shall so notify
                the player no later than the sixth business day following the
                execution of the Contract.
         (ii)   The Team’s determination that the player has passed the
                physical examination shall be a condition precedent to the
                validity of the Contract. Accordingly, and without limiting
                the generality of the preceding sentence, until such time as
                a player has passed the physical examination, the
                prohibitions set forth in Section 13(b) above shall continue
                to apply to the Team and player.
         (iii)  A Required Tender or a Qualifying Offer may contain an
                Exhibit 6. If a player accepts such a Required Tender or
                Qualifying Offer but does not pass the required physical
                examination, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall
                be deemed to have been withdrawn, which shall have the
                consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article
                XI, Section 4, as the case may be.
   (i) A player who knows he has an injury, illness, or condition that
renders, or he knows will likely render, him physically unable to perform
the playing services required under a Player Contract may not validly enter
into such Contract without prior written disclosure of such injury, illness,
or condition to the Team.
