    (2) Except as set forth in Section 12(c)(4) below: (i) the Base
    Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player (other than a Two-
    Way Player) shall be collected in twelve (12) equal installments
    from each of the player’s semi-monthly Compensation payments
    on each Deduction Date; (ii) the Performance Bonus Escrow
    Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be collected in one (1)
    installment on the Performance Bonus Deduction Date; (iii) the
    Trade Bonus Escrow Amount for each Adjustment Player shall be
    collected in one (1) installment on the Trade Bonus Deduction

    Player under a Two-Way Contract shall be collected by the Two-
    Way Player’s Team by deducting ten percent (10%) of the portion
    of the player’s Two-Way NBA Salary on each of the applicable
    twelve (12) semi-monthly Compensation payments on each
    Deduction Date.
    (3) The procedure for deducting and depositing Escrow Amounts
    shall be as follows:
    (i)     The NBA will prepare and send to the Players Association
            the Escrow Schedules on or before November 8 of each
            Salary Cap Year, and periodically thereafter to reflect any
            new or adjusted Escrow Amounts calculated in accordance
            with Section 12(c)(4) below.           Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, the Escrow Schedules prepared during the
            Regular Season shall not include Base Escrow Amounts in
            respect of Two-Way Players. The Escrow Schedules in
            respect of the May 1 Deduction Date shall be updated to
            include Base Escrow Amounts in respect of Two-Way
            Players.
    (ii)    (A)      Within three (3) business days after each Deduction
                     Date, each Team shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
                     in accordance with the Salary Escrow Agreement,
                     the aggregate Base Escrow Amounts that the Team
                     is obligated to deduct with respect to such
                     Deduction Date for all of its Adjustment Players
