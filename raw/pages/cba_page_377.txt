                                                 Article XXII    355
(iv) If at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the
     waiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team
     submitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the
     highest order of preference in accordance with the waiver
     procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-
     Laws. If no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least one
     (1) Partial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract shall be
     awarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver
     Claim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1) Team
     submits the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars, to
     the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in
     total dollars that is entitled to the highest order of
     preference in accordance with the waiver procedures set
     forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws).
(v)  If there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim
     submitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the
     Contract shall be terminated.
(vi) In the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the
     “Claiming Team”) as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:
     (A)      The Claiming Team shall be responsible for
              payment of the player’s Base Compensation in an
              amount equal to the total dollar amount of the
              Partial Waiver Claim allocated over the Remaining
              Protected Years of the Contract in proportion to
              the Base Compensation amounts provided for in
              each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract
              (e.g., if the player has two (2) years remaining on his
              Contract with a $10 million fully-protected Base
              Compensation in year one and an $11 million fifty
              percent (50%)-protected Base Compensation in
              year two and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was
              for $6 million, the Claiming Team shall be
              responsible for $2.86 million of the player’s Base
              Compensation in year one and $3.14 million in year
              two) (the “Claiming Team Base Compensation
              Obligation”).         The waiving team shall be
              responsible for paying the total Base Compensation
