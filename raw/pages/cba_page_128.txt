106   Article IV
           (iii) if the player is an Eligible Canadian Resident in respect
           of the HRA Benefit, the amount of the contribution to fund
           the HRA Benefit for such Season that such player would be
           entitled to under Section 3(a)(1) but for the fact that he is a
           Canadian Tax Resident; provided that, for the avoidance of
           doubt, the Gross Amount(s) previously allocated to such
           player in lieu of the HRA Benefit for years in which he was an
           Eligible Canadian Resident in respect of the HRA Benefit
           shall be applied against the dollar limitations in Section 3(a)(1);
           and
           (iv) if the player is an Eligible Canadian Resident in respect
           of the 401(k) Plan, the amount of the Matching Contribution
           (as defined in the 401(k) Plan) for such season assuming that
           the Eligible Canadian Resident had made the maximum player
           deferral permitted under the 401(k) Plan for such Season.
      (4) “Adjusted Gross Amount” shall mean the adjusted gross
      amount that is equal to the Eligible Canadian Resident’s Gross
      Amount less the amount of EHT on such adjusted gross amount.
  (b) Cash payment. For each Season during the term of this
Agreement, each Eligible Canadian Resident shall be entitled to a single
sum payment subject to the following terms and conditions:
      (1) The amount of the payment shall equal the Eligible Canadian
      Resident’s Adjusted Gross Amount in respect of such Season, less
      all amounts required to be withheld by any governmental authority,
      and less the employer’s share of payroll taxes for the Eligible
      Canadian Resident (the “Cash Payment”).
      (2) The Cash Payment shall be paid in Canadian dollars to the
      Eligible Canadian Resident by no later than the December 31
      immediately following the end of the Season to which the payment
      relates. For purposes of calculating the Cash Payment, the
      Adjusted Gross Amount shall be calculated in U.S. dollars and
      then converted to Canadian dollars using the nominal noon
      exchange rate quoted by the Bank of Canada for converting U.S.
      dollars into Canadian dollars on the first day of the month in
      which the Cash Payment is made, or if there is no such U.S. dollar
