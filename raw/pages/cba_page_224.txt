       makes such application through the date upon which the
       Exception is granted.
       (8) If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a
       Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 6(c) and such request is
       denied, the Team shall not be permitted to make any subsequent
       request for an Exception to replace the same player pursuant to
       this Section 6(c) unless ninety (90) days have passed since the first
       request was denied and the Team establishes that the subsequent
       request is based on a new injury or an aggravation of the same
       injury. If a Team makes a request for an Exception to replace a
       Disabled Player for a Season pursuant to this Section 6(c), then,
       whether such request is granted or denied, the Team shall be
       permitted to renew its request for an Exception to replace the
       Disabled Player for a subsequent Season(s) by applying for another
       Exception in respect of that player for such Season in accordance
       with the rules set forth in this Section 6(c).
  (d) Bi-annual Exception. Subject to the rules set forth in Section
6(m) below:
       (1) A Team shall be permitted to use the Bi-annual Exception
       during a Salary Cap Year only if (i) the Team’s Team Salary at the
       time the Exception is used and at all times thereafter during the
       Salary Cap Year does not exceed the Tax Level for such Salary Cap
       Year plus the Tax Apron Amount (as defined in Section 6(m)(3)
       below), and (ii) at the time the Exception is used, the Team has not
       already used either the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or the
       Mid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams in that same Salary
       Cap Year. During each Salary Cap Year in which a Team is
       permitted to use the Bi-annual Exception, a Team may sign one (1)
       or more Player Contracts, not to exceed two (2) Seasons in length,
       that, in the aggregate, provide for Salaries and Unlikely Bonuses in
       the first Salary Cap Year totaling up to the amounts set forth
       below:
                                                   Bi-annual Exception
       For the 2017-18 Salary Cap            $3.290 million
