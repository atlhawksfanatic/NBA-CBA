                                                         Article VII   189
       subsequently matches the Offer Sheet and enters into a Contract
       with that player, the Team may rescind the renunciation (in the
       case where a Team renounces only one player) or all such
       renunciations (in the case where the Team renounces more than
       one player) within two (2) business days of the date the Offer
       Sheet is matched (or, if the Prior Team conditions its match on the
       player reporting for and passing a physical, within two (2) business
       days of the player passing the physical), whereupon any such
       “unrenounced” player may again sign a Player Contract with the
       Team as a First Round Pick, Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early
       Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free
       Agent, as the case may be, and will again be included in his Prior
       Team’s Team Salary at his applicable Free Agent Amount;
       provided, however, that a Team may not rescind the renunciation
       of a player if (i) at the time the player was renounced the Team’s
       Team Salary was at or below the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing”
       the player would cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the
       Salary Cap, or (ii) at the time the player was renounced the Team’s
       Team Salary was above the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the
       player would cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary
       Cap by more than the amount by which the Team’s Team Salary
       exceeded the Salary Cap prior to the renunciation.
       (2) A Team cannot renounce any player to whom the Team has
       made a Qualifying Offer until such time as the Qualifying Offer is
       no longer in effect.
   (h) Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending
injury or illness, and whose Contract is terminated by the Team in
accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his
Team’s Team Salary as follows:
       (1) Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, a Team may apply to the
       NBA to have the player’s Salary for each remaining Salary Cap
       Year covered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary
       beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the last Regular
       Season or playoff game in which the player played; provided that if
       the player played in fewer than ten (10) Regular Season and playoff
       games in the last Season in which he played, then the earliest date
       upon which a Team may apply to the NBA to have the player’s
