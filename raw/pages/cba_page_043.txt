                                                              Article II    21
                NBA Development League (“NBADL”) prior to the
                deadline set by the NBADL for NBADL teams to
                designate affiliate players, (b) is initially assigned by the
                NBADL to such Team’s NBADL affiliate as listed in
                Exhibit 10 and timely reports to such affiliate, and (c) does
                not leave the NBADL (e.g., by buying out his contract with
                the NBADL and signing a contract with an international
                team) for a period of sixty (60) days after signing with the
                NBADL; provided, however, that an Exhibit 10 may only
                contain an Exhibit 10 Bonus if the Team has an NBADL
                affiliate at the time of the execution of the Contract.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Team with an NBADL
                affiliate acquires by assignment a Contract with a
                Conversion Protection Amount but without an Exhibit 10
                Bonus (the “Acquired Exhibit 10”), the Acquired Exhibit
                10 shall be deemed to include an Exhibit 10 Bonus equal to
                the Conversion Protection Amount; and
           (ii) stating that, if the Team exercises the Two-Way Player
                Conversion Option prior to the first day of the NBA
                Regular Season in accordance with Section 11(i) below, the
                Compensation provided for by the Contract will be
                protected for lack of skill and injury or illness in an amount
                between $5,000 and $50,000 (the “Conversion Protection
                Amount”); provided, however, that if the Exhibit 10
                contains an Exhibit 10 Bonus, the Exhibit 10 must also
                contain a Conversion Protection Amount and the
                Conversion Protection Amount must be equal to the
                Exhibit 10 Bonus.
In the event that NBADL rules permit a Team, other than the Team that
last requested waivers on the player, to designate the player as an affiliate
player (the “Designating Team”), the Designating Team shall be
responsible for paying the Exhibit 10 Bonus to the player provided that (a)
the Designating Team designates the player as an affiliate player, (b) prior
to the waiver, the Designating Team was a party to the Contract containing
the Exhibit 10 Bonus, and (c) the player satisfies the conditions set forth in
Section 3(q)(i) above with respect to the Designating Team’s NBADL
affiliate.
