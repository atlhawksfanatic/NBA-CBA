  CREATION OF PLAYER LONGITUDINAL PROFILES
The following protocol will be used to create the Longitudinal Profiles
described in Article XXXIII, Section 18 above:
        Step 1: Beginning with the 2017-18 Season, the Program’s
        drug collection company will assign each player a unique
        personal identification number.        A player’s personal
        identification number will remain the same for all periods
        of time he is covered by the Program, and will only be used
        for the purposes of the Longitudinal Profile. Other than to
        the designated representatives or employees within the
        drug collection company and the Laboratory, the drug
        collection company will not disclose the personal
        identification number that corresponds to the player’s
        name to any individual other than one representative each
        of the NBA and the Players Association.
        Step 2: The Laboratory (as defined in Article XXXIII,
        Section 18(a)) will maintain a secure, separate database for
        each player’s personal identification number that contains
        his      corresponding      Testosterone       concentration,
        epitestosterone     concentration      and     Testosterone/
        Epitestosterone (“T/E”) ratio (referred to collectively as
        the “Baseline Values”). This database will not contain any
        identifying information for the players.
        Step 3: The Baseline Values will be calculated, pursuant to
        the Laboratory’s operating standards, by averaging a
        player’s T/E ratio, Testosterone concentration and
        Epitestosterone concentration, respectively, from three
        negative tests conducted under the Program. After a
        player’s Baseline Values are established, those values will be
        considered a player’s Longitudinal Profile for the duration
        of his coverage under the Program. New Baseline Values
