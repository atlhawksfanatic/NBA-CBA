                                                           Article VII     233
         (ii)    With respect to any amounts of BRI or Total Salaries and
                 Benefits (or portions thereof) as to which the Accountants
                 have not completed their review or which are the subject of
                 a good faith dispute between the parties, the NBA’s good
                 faith proposal as to the proper amount, if any, that should
                 be included in the Audit Report.
         (iii)   With respect to any items of Escrow Information that are
                 the subject of a good faith dispute between the parties, the
                 Accountants’ good faith determination as to such items,
                 taking into account the provisions of Section 10(a)(4)(i) and
                 (ii).
   As soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is submitted to

Audit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed in
writing their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such
Report or all disputes with respect to such Report have been finally
resolved by means of the dispute-resolution procedures provided for by
this Agreement.
   If, at the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period (as defined
by Section 12(a)(5) below), the Accountants have not submitted or are
unable to submit a final Audit Report (because, by way of example but not

Article XXXII, Section 9(c) and which remain pending), the Accountants
shall prepare and submit to the parties, within five (5) business days
following the completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, an Interim
Escrow Audit Report that shall include the information set forth in the
Interim Audit Report as adjusted or amended so as to reflect any final
determinations made by the System Arbitrator or the Appeals Panel (as the

for the calculations to be made pursuant to Section 12 below.
