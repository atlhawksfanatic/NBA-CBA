124      Article VI
Section 14. Player Convictions Involving Alcohol or Controlled
               Substances.
    In addition to any other discipline imposed by the NBA for such
conduct, any player who is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no
contest, or nolo contendere to) driving while intoxicated, driving under the
influence, driving under the influence of a controlled substance (if that
controlled substance is not a Prohibited Substance) or any similar crime
shall be required to submit to a mandatory evaluation by the Medical
Director of the Anti-Drug Program. After that mandatory evaluation, the
Medical Director may require the player to attend up to ten (10) substance
abuse counseling sessions.
Section 15. Player Arrests.
    A Team shall not impose discipline on a player solely on the basis of the
fact that the player has been arrested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a
Team may impose discipline on a player for the conduct underlying the
player’s arrest if it has an independent basis for doing so, (b) nothing
herein shall permit a Team to discipline a player for his failure to cooperate
with a Team’s investigation of his alleged misconduct if he has a
reasonable apprehension of criminal prosecution, and (c) nothing herein
shall prevent a Team from precluding a player from participating in Team
activities without loss of pay to the extent it otherwise has the right to do
so.
Section 16. Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic Violence, Sexual
               Assault, and Child Abuse.
    Effective July 1, 2017, the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse (and any amendments thereto),
which is attached as Exhibit F hereto, shall apply and remain in effect.
Any evaluation, counseling, treatment, and/or discipline of a player for
engaging in acts covered by this Policy shall be governed by the terms of
the Policy.
