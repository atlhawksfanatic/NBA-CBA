                                                             Exhibit F      F-11
participation in the investigation is in good faith. Such retaliation includes,
but is not limited to, threats, intimidation, harassment, and any adverse
employment or other action, whether express or implied. Anyone who
retaliates, or threatens to retaliate, against an individual who reports, or
participates in an investigation into, an alleged violation of this Policy, or
against any victim or other witness, will be subject to independent
disciplinary action.
    As with any complaint brought in bad faith, any individual, including
coaches, general managers, or other team officials, who reports a violation
of this Policy knowing such claim is malicious, false, or fundamentally
frivolous shall be subject to disciplinary action.
Reporting
    Anyone who is the victim of or acting on behalf of a victim of domestic
violence, sexual assault, or child abuse, as defined by this Policy, is strongly
encouraged to call the hotline established under this Policy as soon as
possible after the incident to discuss the availability of counseling,
treatment, security, and other appropriate resources.
    If you are in immediate danger or involved in a situation in which
another person is in immediate danger, the Parties recommend that you
contact 911 or your local police department. Support and crisis
intervention is also available from the National Domestic Violence Hotline
at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).
