                                                       Article XXII    361
    (h) A player will have full access to all data collected on him from
approved Wearables. Members of the Teamâ€™s staff may also have access
to such data but it can be used only for limited purposes as set forth
below. Data collected from a Wearable worn at the request of a Team may
be used for player health and performance purposes and Team on-court
tactical and strategic purposes only. The data may not be considered, used,
discussed or referenced for any other purpose such as in negotiations
regarding a future Player Contract or other Player Contract transaction
(e.g., a trade or waiver) involving the player. In a proceeding brought by
the Players Association under the procedures set forth in Article XXXI,
the Grievance Arbitrator will have authority to impose a fine of up to
$250,000 on any Team shown to have violated this provision.
    (i) The parties agree to continue to discuss in good faith the use of
Wearables in games and the commercialization of data from Wearables.
Pending an agreement between the parties, Wearables may not be used in
games, and no player data collected from a Wearable worn at the request
of a Team may be made available to the public in any way or used for any
commercial purpose.
