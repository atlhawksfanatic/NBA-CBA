                                                             Exhibit F      F-7
Administrative Leave
   While an investigation is pending, the Commissioner may at any time
place the player on administrative leave with pay for a reasonable period of
time. The parties agree that administrative leave is not intended to be
routinely applied during the pendency of every player investigation under
this Policy. Instead, administrative leave should be applied in only those
cases in which a balancing of all relevant factors clearly establishes that it is
reasonable to do so under the totality of the circumstances.
   In deciding whether to place a player on paid administrative leave, the
Commissioner shall consider among other relevant factors the following
non-exhaustive list of factors:
       The nature and severity of the allegation(s), including whether a
        weapon was involved and whether any injury was suffered by
        anyone (including the player);
       Whether the allegations are supported by credible information;
       The relationship between the player and accuser;
       Information regarding the player’s history of prior similar conduct,
        or lack thereof;
       The prior criminal or disciplinary history of the player, or lack
        thereof;
       The status of any criminal investigation and/or prosecution
        regarding the alleged incident, including whether any arrests have
        been made;
       The character of the player;
       The player’s reputation within the NBA community;
       The NBA’s past practice regarding discipline imposed on a player
        for similar allegations; and
       The risk of reputational damage to the NBA and/or the player’s
        team.
   The NBA will give prompt notice to the NBPA, the player’s team, and
the player of any decision to place a player on paid administrative leave
pursuant to this Policy. The decision to place the player on paid
administrative leave pending an investigation shall not preclude further
