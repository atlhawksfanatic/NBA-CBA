                                                   Article VII      211
6(j)(4), if the player’s immediately prior Contract was a one-year
Contract that provided for Salary equal to the Minimum Player
Salary (with no Unlikely Bonuses), the player’s prior Salary shall
include the portion of the Minimum Player Salary, if any, that was
reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described in
Article IV, Section 6(g).
(5) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended
beginning with the 2017-18 Season (but in the case of Extensions,
only with respect to the extended term), for purposes of calculating
a Team’s Traded Player Exception under this Section 6(j):
(i)      A Traded Player’s Salary shall be deemed reduced by the
         amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation that is
         not fully-protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at
         the time of the trade.
(ii)     For purposes of Section 6(j)(5)(i) above, with respect to the
         assignment of Player Contracts occurring during the period
         from January 10 through the last day of the Regular
         Season, a Traded Player’s Base Compensation for such
         Season shall be deemed fully-protected for lack of skill and
         injury or illness.
(iii)    With respect to the assignment of Player Contracts
         occurring during the period from the day following the last
         day of a Regular Season through June 30 of that Salary Cap
         Year, a Traded Player’s Salary will equal the lesser of: (x)
         the player’s Salary for the current Salary Cap Year; and (y)
         the player’s Salary for the subsequent Salary Cap Year
         reduced by the amount of the player’s unearned Base
         Compensation that is not fully-protected for lack of skill
         and injury or illness for the subsequent Salary Cap Year at
         the time of the trade.
         To illustrate the foregoing, assume that a Team seeks to
         replace a Traded Player whose (i) Base Compensation and
         Salary for both the current and subsequent Seasons is $8
         million, and (ii) Contract provides for Base Compensation
         protection for lack of skill and injury or illness equal to $1
