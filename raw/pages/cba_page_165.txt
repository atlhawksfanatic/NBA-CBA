        Manual: Ticket related expenses: 1002.15-.22, 1002.29-.34,
        1012.27-.30; premium seating: 1002.23-.28; suites: 1002.40-

        signage: 1006.21-.27. For the avoidance of doubt, for the
        2015-16 Salary Cap Year, the total Team and Related Party
        revenues and expenses that would have been subject to the
        new nine and one-half percent (9.5%) expense cap were the
        amounts identified in the parties’ letter agreement, dated
        January 19, 2017. For the purposes of Article VII, Section

        revenues and expenses reported in the “playoff gate

        cap. Such playoff-related expenses will continue to be
        deductible in accordance with the terms of the 2011 CBA
        as reflected in the Audit Report for the 2015-16 Salary Cap
        Year. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes will be deducted
        from revenues included in BRI under Sections 1(a)(1)(i),
        (iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x), (xi), (xiii) and (xiv) (to the extent set
        forth in those subsections) before the application of the
        nine and one-half percent (9.5%) ratio in calculating the
        uniform expense cap, and before the deduction of
