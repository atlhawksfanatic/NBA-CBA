      (9)      The organizer guarantees that the game will
               produce at least $100,000 for charity, and, if

               form satisfactory to the NBA and the Players
               Association which grants the NBA and/or the
               Players Association the right to sue to recover such
               amount for the benefit of the charity;
      (10)     The game is played in the United States or Canada;

               revenues and expenses, in a form acceptable to the
               NBA and the Players Association, within sixty (60)
               days following the game.
(iii) Additional Summer League Requirements. The NBA
      will consider an off-season summer league for approval
      only if, in addition to the general requirements set forth in
      Section 3(a)(i) above and such other reasonable
      requirements as the NBA may impose, the arrangements
      made with respect to each summer league game in which
      an NBA player participates also satisfy the following:

               competition of basketball skills (such as a slam
               dunk contest), unless such exhibition or
               competition has been separately approved in
               writing by the NBA;
      (3)      There is at least one (1) trainer or at least one (1)
               physician or other emergency medical personnel
