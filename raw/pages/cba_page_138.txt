     In addition to any other rights a Team or the NBA may have by

refuses, without proper and reasonable cause or excuse, to render the
services required by a Player Contract or this Agreement, or when a player
is, for proper cause, suspended by his Team or the NBA in accordance
with the terms of such Contract or this Agreement, the Current Base
Compensation payable to the player for the year of the Contract during
which such refusal or failure and/or suspension occurs may be reduced
(or, in the case of a suspension, shall be reduced) by (a) 1/145th of the
player’s Base Compensation for each missed Exhibition, Regular Season or
Playoff game for any suspension of less than twenty (20) games and (b)
1/110th of the player’s Base Compensation for each missed Exhibition,
Regular Season or Playoff game for any suspension of twenty (20) games
or more (including any indefinite suspension that persists for twenty (20)
games or more or consecutive suspensions for continuing acts or conduct
that persist for twenty (20) games or more).
