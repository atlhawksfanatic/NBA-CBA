188   Article VII
      its Team Salary, then the Team’s Team Salary shall be increased by
      an amount calculated as follows:
      STEP 1:     Subtract from twelve (12) the number of players
                  included in Team Salary.
      STEP 2:     If the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the
                  result in Step 1 by the Minimum Annual Salary
                  applicable to players with zero (0) Years of Service
                  under the Minimum Annual Salary Scale for that Salary
                  Cap Year.
      (2) In determining whether a Team has fewer than twelve (12)
      players included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 4(f)(1)
      above only, the only players who shall be counted are (i) players
      under Contract with the Team who are included in Team Salary,
      (ii) Free Agents who are included in Team Salary pursuant to
      Section 4(a)(2) above, (iii) players to whom Offer Sheets have been
      given, and (iv) unsigned First Round Picks who are included in
      Team Salary pursuant to Section 4(e) above.
  (g) Renouncing.
      (1) To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team must provide the
      NBA with a written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the
      player, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season
      covered by the player’s Contract. (The NBA shall notify the
      Players Association of any such renunciation by email within two
      (2) business days following receipt of notice of such renunciation.)
      If a Team renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the player will no
      longer qualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying
      Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the
      case may be, and the Team will only be permitted to re-sign such
      player with Room (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant
      to Section 6(b) below), pursuant to the Minimum Player Salary
      Exception, or to a Two-Way Contract. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, in the event a Team renounces one or more players
      pursuant to this Section 6(g) (or, with respect to a First Round
      Pick, pursuant to Article X, Section 4(g)) in order to create Room
      for an Offer Sheet, and the offeree-player’s Prior Team
