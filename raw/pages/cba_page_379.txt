                                               Article XXII     357
      (D)     The Claiming Team shall be responsible for making
              all payments to the player (and paying all related
              payroll taxes) other than Compensation due with
              respect to any Season prior to the waiver. The
              waiving team shall reimburse the Claiming Team
              for the portion of the Waiving Team Base
              Compensation Obligation applicable to each pay
              period on or before each applicable pay date.
(vii) In the event that the Contract is awarded to the Claiming
      Team as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim and the Claiming
      Team subsequently waives the player (a “Subsequent
      Waiver”) resulting in the termination of the Contract:
      (A)     Without taking into consideration any conditional
              Base Compensation protection triggered after the
              date of the initial request for waivers but before the
              Subsequent Waiver (hereinafter referred to as
              “Triggered Base Compensation Protection”), if the
              Contract contains full Base Compensation
              protection in each of the Remaining Protected
              Years or if the Contract contains no Remaining
              Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base
              Compensation Obligation and the Waiving Team
              Base Compensation Obligation shall remain
              unchanged.
      (B)     Without taking into consideration any Triggered
              Base Compensation Protection, if the Contract
              contains partial protection in one (1) or more of the
              Remaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team
              Base Compensation Obligation and Waiving Team
              Base Compensation Obligation for each such year
              shall be adjusted as follows upon the termination of
              the Contract:
              (1)     The Claiming Team Base Compensation
                      Obligation for any Remaining Protected
                      Year that contains only partial Base
                      Compensation protection shall be reduced
