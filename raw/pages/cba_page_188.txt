166   Article VII
      Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except
      assume Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season ($4.578 billion) exceeds actual
      BRI for the 2013-14 Season ($4.2 billion) by 9%. The Salary Cap for the
      2014-15 Season would be reduced by $0.50 million ($34 million (the Overage
      of 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits ($170 million) less 6% of Total
      Salaries and Benefits ($136 million)), less $19 million (i.e., the difference
      between (x) Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season ($4.578 billion) less
      actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season ($4.2 billion) (i.e., $378 million) and (y)
      8% of actual BRI for the 2013-14 Season (i.e., $336 million) -- a difference
      of $42 million -- multiplied by 44.74%), divided by 30).
      (3) In the event that the Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year is
      calculated based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior Salary
      Cap Year in accordance with Section 2(a)(4) above and BRI and
      Total Salaries and Benefits as set forth in the Audit Report for the
      prior Salary Cap Year are different from those in the Interim Audit
      Report such that the Salary Cap would have been different from
      that based upon the Interim Audit Report, any such difference in
      the Salary Cap shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to
      the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, except that,
      with respect to the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year (or, in the alternative,
      if either the NBA or Players Association exercises its option to
      terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIX, the 2022-23
      Salary Cap Year) any such differences shall be debited or credited,
      as the case may be, to the Salary Cap for the then current Salary
      Cap Year, in all such cases with interest (at a rate equal to the one
      (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on
      the date of the issuance of the Interim Audit Report).
  (e) Guarantee.
      (1) In the event that for any Salary Cap Year Total Salaries and
      Benefits is less than the Designated Share (as defined in Section
      12(b)(3) below) for such Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall be
      obligated to pay the difference (a “Guarantee Shortfall”) to all
      NBA players who were on an NBA roster during the Regular
      Season covered by such Salary Cap Year. Any such Guarantee
      Shortfall obligation shall be effectuated and satisfied solely by the
      NBA paying such Guarantee Shortfall to Teams no later than sixty
      (60) days following the completion of the Audit Report for such
