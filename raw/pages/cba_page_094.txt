72 Article IV
           of Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management
           Relations Act of 1947, as amended) of the Pension
           Plan or Trust because of a tie vote or lack of a
           quorum at two (2) successive meetings of the
           Trustees, then the Trustees shall, upon written
           application of the NBA Trustees or the Players
           Association Trustees, submit such dispute to an
           impartial umpire in accordance with the American
           Arbitration Association’s Impartial Umpire Rules
           for Arbitration of Impasses Between Trustees of
           Joint Employee Benefit Trust Funds. The decision
           of said umpire shall be final, binding and conclusive
           upon the Trustees and all persons concerned. To
           the extent permitted by applicable laws, the fee of
           the impartial umpire and the American Arbitration
           Association, together with such other costs and
           expenses as may be authorized by the Trustees,
           shall be proper charges against the Trust, which the
           Trustees are authorized to pay.
           The impartial umpire in his or her decision shall be
           bound by the provisions of the Pension Plan, the
           Pension Trust Agreement and the charters, rules,
           policies and procedures put in place by past or
           current Pension Plan fiduciaries (the “Governing
           Documents”). The impartial umpire shall have no
           power or authority to add to or subtract from the
           Governing Documents or to change, modify or
           amend the provisions of the Governing
           Documents or the Collective Bargaining
           Agreement between the NBA and the Players
           Association.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
           Trustees appointed by the NBA nor the Trustees
           appointed by the Players Association may compel
           arbitration regarding a claim for benefits that would
           be time-barred under the Pension Plan or
           applicable law.
