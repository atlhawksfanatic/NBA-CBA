J-1-2    Exhibit J-1
Player Representative or outside advisor to agree, in writing (in the form of
acknowledgment annexed hereto), to comply with the terms of this
Confidentiality Agreement, and the Players Association shall promptly
provide copies of such writings to the NBA.
                2.      The Players Association shall maintain the absolute
confidentiality of all Confidential Information at all times and shall not
disclose, disseminate or provide Confidential Information to any person or
entity (including, but not limited to, any NBA players who are not officers
of the Players Association and any representative of any player) at any time
or for any purpose, except as permitted herein. The Players Association
agrees that it may use or refer to Confidential Information only during the
course of the Audit and solely for the purpose of conducting the Audit in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the CBA and this
Confidentiality Agreement, and that Confidential Information may not be
used or referred to by the Players Association, at any time, for any other
purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else in this letter
agreement, the Players Association may only disclose or provide a
summary of Confidential Information to Player Representatives in
aggregate form without identifying any specific information (e.g., by

Agreement, the Players Association shall not be deemed to have violated
any provision herein if the Players Association discloses to such third party
that the Audit is being undertaken and that the Players Association is
subject to a confidentiality agreement and, therefore, not permitted to
discuss the Audit. The foregoing shall not foreclose the Players
Association from disclosing Confidential Information during the course of
a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel
of an award of the System Arbitrator and a judicial action to enforce any
such proceeding or award.
                3.      The Players Association shall adopt and implement
such procedures to insure the confidentiality of Confidential Information
as would be employed by a reasonable and prudent person to safeguard

more stringent, such procedures as are employed for such purposes by the
Players Association for such information. Such procedures shall include,
but not be limited to, steps to insure that: (a) such Confidential
