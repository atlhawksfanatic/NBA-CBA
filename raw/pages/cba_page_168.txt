            (15%) below the fair market value of such rights over the
            term of such agreement. In making such determination,
            the TV Expert may take into account factors such as the
            nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship
            between the Team and the Related Party, any amounts
            included in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related
            Parties) that have entered into comparable transactions,
            arrangements      and/or      relationships      with    other
            programming licensors, market conditions, the nature of

            shall BRI include consideration paid to a Related Party in
            connection with rights acquired by such Related Party from
            a Team for fair market value, even if such consideration
            relates to NBA games or NBA-related activities (including,
            by way of example and not limitation, advertising revenue
            or subscriber fees earned by a Related Party television
            network that relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of
            NBA games licensed to the television network by a Team).
            In the event that the TV Expert determines that such
            aggregate amount is more than fifteen percent (15%) above
            or below fair market value, the TV Expert shall be
            instructed to submit to the parties the amount for each
            Season of such agreement that he determines reflects the
            fair market value of such rights and such amounts, and no
            other amounts, shall be included in BRI with respect to
            such agreement for each Salary Cap Year covered by such
            agreement. Any determination made by the TV Expert
