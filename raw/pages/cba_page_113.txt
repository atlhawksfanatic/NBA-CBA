                                                            Article IV    91
        shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have
        incurred in providing the relevant benefit(s) under the Health and
        Welfare Benefit Plan commencing on the date of termination. Any
        such alternative arrangement(s) shall, to the extent permitted by
        applicable law and the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan, be funded
        by such monies as may then remain in the Health and Welfare
        Benefit Trust and, if the monies remaining in the Health and
        Welfare Benefit Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are
        insufficient for, such purpose, such alternative arrangement(s) shall
        be funded by the NBA Teams.                  Any such alternative
        arrangement(s) shall be operated and administered in a manner that
        will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible
        under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws)
        when paid. If funded by the Teams (and not funded out of monies
        remaining in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust), the costs of
        funding an alternative arrangement to the HRA Benefit shall be
        applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8
        below, and shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit
        Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to
        Section 8(b)(7) below. The costs of funding any alternative
        arrangement(s) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this
        Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the
        Players Association fail to agree with respect to any alternative
        arrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree shall not
        create any right: (x) to unilaterally implement, during the term of
        this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits
        provided or to be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit
        Plan; (y) to lockout; or (z) to strike.
   (e) Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount. The
following amounts shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount
provided for by Section 8 below:
        (1) All costs of the HRA Benefit that are paid by the Teams (and
        not paid out of the amounts forfeited under the Health and
        Welfare Benefit Plan) shall be (i) applied against the New Benefit
        Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (ii) limited to the
        portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for
        this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below. For the avoidance
        of doubt, to the extent that costs of the HRA Benefit in a Salary
