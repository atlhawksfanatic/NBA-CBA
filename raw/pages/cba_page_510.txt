good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an
injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any
basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as
to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, unfit to play
skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player
until such time as, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is in
sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event
of such suspension, the Base Compensation payable to the Player for any
Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as
the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team’s
physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length
of such Season. Nothing in this subparagraph shall authorize the Team to
suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.
   (c) If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct
result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the
Team, the Team will pay the Player’s reasonable hospitalization and
medical expenses (including doctor’s bills), provided that the hospital and
doctor are selected by the Team, that the Team shall be obligated to pay
only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused
solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. The
Team will also pay costs associated with a second opinion in accordance
with Article XXII, Section 10 of the CBA. Subject to the provisions set
forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player’s
injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to
play skilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no
event after the Player has received his full Base Compensation for the
Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player
the Base Compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such
Season (or in the case of a Two-Way Contract, so long as such unfitness
continues but in no event after the Two-Way Player has received his Two-
Way Annual NBADL Salary for such NBADL Regular Season (prorated as
necessary if the Two-Way Contract was entered into after the start of the
NBADL Regular Season) plus (i) any Two-Way NBA Salary earned by
such Two-Way Player during such NBA Regular Season prior to the date
of such unfitness, less (ii) such Two-Way Player’s Two-Way NBADL
Salary covering the number of NBA Days of Service accrued by such Two-
Way Player during such NBA Regular Season prior to the date of such
unfitness). The Team’s obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (x) any
workers’ compensation benefits, which, to the extent permitted by law, the
