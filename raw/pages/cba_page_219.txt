                                                        Article VII    197
       provide for up to the same percentage of Unlikely Bonuses in the
       first year of the extended term; and (ii) no Renegotiation may
       provide for an increase in Unlikely Bonuses if, after the
       Renegotiation, the amount of Unlikely Bonuses in respect of any
       Salary Cap Year covered by the renegotiated Contract exceeds
       fifteen (15%) of the player’s Regular Salary for such Salary Cap
       Year.
       (2) No Player Contract may provide for any Unlikely Bonus for
       the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract that, if included
       in the player’s Salary for such Salary Cap Year, would result in the
       Team’s Team Salary exceeding the Room under which it is signing
       the Contract. For the sole purpose of determining whether a
       Team has Room for a new Unlikely Bonus, the Team’s Room shall
       be deemed reduced by all Unlikely Bonuses in Contracts approved
       by the Commissioner that may be paid to all of the Team’s players
       that entered into Player Contracts (including Renegotiations)
       during that Salary Cap Year.
  (e) No Futures Contracts. Subject to Section 5(e)(4) below, but
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement:
       (1) Every Player Contract must cover at least the then-current
       Season (or the upcoming Season in the case of a Contract entered
       into from July 1 through the day prior to the first day of the
       Season).
       (2) No Team and player may enter into a Player Contract from
       the commencement of the Team’s last game of the Regular Season
       through the following June 30. The preceding sentence shall not
       prohibit a Team and player from entering into an amendment to an
       existing Player Contract during such period if such amendment
       would otherwise be permitted under this Agreement.
       (3) A Player Contract that covers more than one (1) Season must
       be for a consecutive period of Seasons.
       (4) (i) A player who receives a Required Tender or a Qualifying
                Offer during the month of June may accept such Required
