first Salary Cap Year.
(5) (i) In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI,
         directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result
         of changes in accounting methods or practices), the
         purpose of this provision being to preclude the double-
         counting of revenues, whether in the same or in multiple
         Salary Cap Years.
(ii)     In no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI,
         directly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result
         of changes in accounting methods or practices), the
         purpose of this provision being to preclude the double-
         counting of expenses, whether in the same or in multiple
         Salary Cap Years.
(6) Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit

(i)      With respect to expenses incurred in connection with      all
         proceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above,          all
         reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to       be
         reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not     be
         the subject of the accounting procedures set forth         in
         Section 10 below.
(ii)     With respect to expenses incurred in connection with all

         incurred by Properties as reflected in the audited financial
         reports of Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1)
         all such reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed
         to be reasonable and customary, and such expenses shall
         not be the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in
         Section 10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed
         to the extent they exceed the ratio of expenses to revenues
         for the category of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
