                                                              Article X    277
    (d) If a Second Round Pick receives and signs a Required Tender and
is subsequently waived by the Team after signing such tender, then the
Team that made the Required Tender to the player shall have exclusive
rights to negotiate with and sign (or convert) the player to a Two-Way
Contract for the Season covered by the Required Tender.
    (e) If a player is drafted by a Team in either an Initial or Subsequent
Draft and that Team does not make a Required Tender to such player, the
player will become a Rookie Free Agent on the July 16 following such
Draft (for a First Round Pick) or on the September 6 following such Draft
(for a Second Round Pick).
    (f) A Team may at any time withdraw a Required Tender it has made
to a player, provided that the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. In
the event that a Required Tender is withdrawn, the player shall thereupon
become a Rookie Free Agent.
    (g) A Team that holds the exclusive rights to negotiate with and sign a
drafted player may at any time renounce such exclusive rights, except that,
if the Team has made a Required Tender to the player, a renunciation shall
not be permitted during the time the player has to accept the Required
Tender under Article I, Section 1(yy). In order to renounce its exclusive
rights with respect to a drafted player, a Team shall provide the NBA with
an express, written statement renouncing such exclusive rights. The NBA
shall provide a copy of such statement to the Players Association within
three (3) business days following its receipt thereof.

that covers all or any part of the NBA Season immediately following said
Initial or Subsequent Draft, or (y) signs such a player contract (either (x) or
