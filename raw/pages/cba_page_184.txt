162 Article VII
            Salary Cap Year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
            which is the total number of days of the Regular Season
            that the player was on the roster of such Team and the
            denominator of which is the total number of days in such
            Regular Season (or, if the Contract was not in effect for the
            entire Regular Season, the number of days in such Regular
            Season during which the Contract was in effect); and (Z)
            the amount to be included in Team Salary for the last such
            Team by which the player was employed under the same
            Player Contract shall equal the player’s Salary in respect of
            the Player Contract less the amount of such Salary allocated
            to other Team(s) in accordance with clause (Y) above. For
            purposes of the foregoing calculation, any reduction in a
            player’s Salary for the applicable Salary Cap Year resulting
            from the termination of the player’s Contract shall be
            allocated to the last Team by which the player was
            employed under such Contract (after first performing the
            allocations described above before giving effect to such
            Salary reduction);
    (ii)    include any Salary in respect of such Salary Cap Year that is
            excluded from the Team’s Team Salary pursuant to Section
            4(h) below; and
    (iii)   exclude any Salary in respect of such Salary Cap Year that
            is included in the Team’s Team Salary pursuant to Section
            3(e) below.
    (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
    sum of (i) the amount of a proposed payment distribution to a
    player for a Salary Cap Year pursuant to this Section 2(b), and (ii)
    the player’s Salary for such Salary Cap Year would exceed the
    player’s applicable Maximum Annual Salary for such Salary Cap
    Year, then such player’s proposed payment distribution for such
    Salary Cap Year pursuant to this Section 2(b) shall be reduced to
    the extent necessary for the sum of the player’s Salary and such
    distribution to equal his applicable Maximum Annual Salary for
    such Salary Cap Year, and the amount of such reduction shall be
    disbursed to the other players on the Team pro rata based upon
    each such player’s payment distribution amount under this Section
