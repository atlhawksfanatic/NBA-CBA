Team, Team Affiliate, or player to produce any tax returns or other

Section 5.     Transactions with Retired Players.
   (a) If (i) a Team or Team Affiliate enters into a transaction after the
date of this Agreement with a retired player who played for the Team
within the five-year (5) period preceding such transaction and the terms of
such transaction provide for the retired player to be paid compensation or
consideration in excess of $10,000 or to be provided with an investment or
business opportunity, and, if (ii) the compensation the retired player
received from the Team when he was a player was substantially below the
then fair market value of such player’s basketball services under the Salary
Cap system, then the NBA may challenge the transaction, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 5(b) below, on the ground that: (A) the
compensation or consideration to the retired player substantially exceeds
the then fair market value of the services or other consideration provided
by the retired player in the transaction; or that (B) the amount of the
retired player’s investment or the benefit conferred upon the retired player
as a result of the investment or business opportunity is not commercially
reasonable, given the relative risks and rewards of such investment.
   (b) (i)       Any challenge under this Section 5 shall be filed in writing
                 with a business valuation expert jointly selected by the
                 NBA and the Players Association. In the event the parties
                 cannot agree on the identity of a business valuation expert,
                 a business valuation expert shall be selected in the same
                 manner set forth in Article XXXI, Section 6 for the
                 selection of a Grievance Arbitrator in the absence of an
                 agreement between the parties. The business valuation
                 expert shall conduct a hearing in which the retired player,
                 the Team and/or Team Affiliate, the Players Association,
                 and the NBA are afforded the opportunity to appear and
                 participate. The NBA shall have the burden of proof in
                 the proceeding. The business valuation expert may permit
                 discovery of relevant documents necessary to undertake the
