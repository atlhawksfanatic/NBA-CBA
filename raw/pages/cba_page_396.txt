374      Article XXVII
Notwithstanding anything in this Article XXVII, a Team shall not be
required to enforce its set-off right against a player in respect of
compensation earned by the player from any non-NBA Subsequent
Team(s). The First Team may require that the player provide the First
Team with evidence (such as a copy of the player’s new contract) of the
compensation to be earned by the player in connection with his services
for any Subsequent Team(s).
   (b) For the purposes of this Article XXVII, (i) a “professional
basketball team” shall mean any team in any country that pays money or
compensation of any kind to a basketball player for rendering services to
such team (other than a reasonable stipend limited to basic living
expenses); and (ii) “compensation” earned by a player shall include all
forms of compensation (including, without limitation, any non-cash
compensation) other than benefits comparable to the type of benefits (e.g.,
medical and dental insurance) provided to an NBA player in accordance
with Article IV above, travel and moving expenses, and any car and
housing provided temporarily by a professional basketball team to the
player during the period of time for which the player renders services to
such team. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
XXVII, when a player receives compensation from a non-NBA
Subsequent Team on a net-of-tax basis, then for purposes of calculating
the amount of set-off to which the NBA Team is entitled pursuant to this
Article XXVII, such compensation from the non-NBA Subsequent Team
shall be deemed to equal the net-of-tax compensation divided by 0.65
(reflecting a deemed thirty-five percent (35%) tax rate); provided, however,
that such adjustment to the player’s compensation from the non-NBA
Subsequent Team shall not be made, or shall be modified accordingly, if
the player can establish that taxes in respect of the player’s compensation
calculated under this provision were not paid, or exceed the actual amount
paid, by the player’s non-NBA Subsequent Team.
   (c) Without limiting any other rights the First Team has, in the event a
player’s compensation is reduced pursuant to this Article XXVII and the
Team is unable to effect all or a portion of the reduction through payroll
deductions, the NBA shall have the right to direct any Subsequent Team
that is an NBA Team to withhold any unrecouped amounts from the
player’s compensation under his new Uniform Player Contract and remit
such amounts to the First Team. To the extent such remedy is insufficient
to effect a full recoupment of the set-off amount, the NBA and Players
