       assignee Team) may provide for Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and
       Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year of up to the Regular

       and Article I, Section 1(ll)) and the Disabled Player Exception,
       shall be reduced daily throughout the end of the Regular Season by
       the amount of the unused Exception as of January 10 multiplied by
       a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator
       of which is the total number of days in such Regular Season.
