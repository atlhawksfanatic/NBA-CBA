penalty otherwise applicable under this Article XXXIII. Such reduction or
rescission (if any) will be determined at the discretion of the Grievance
Arbitrator.
   (b) For purposes of this Section 19, “no significant fault or
negligence” means the unusual circumstance in which the Player did not
know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected, even
with the exercise of considerable caution and diligence, that he was taking,
ingesting, applying, or otherwise using the Drug of Abuse or SPED. To
show that he bears no significant fault or negligence, the Player must also
establish how the Drug of Abuse or SPED entered his system. A Player
cannot satisfy his burden by merely denying that he intentionally used the
Drug of Abuse or SPED.
