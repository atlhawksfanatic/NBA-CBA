376      Article XXVII
Compensation amounts are payable to the player pursuant to the
mandatory stretch provision). The set-off amount in respect of each
remaining Salary Cap Year(s) under the First Contract in which the related
unearned Base Compensation is stretched in accordance with the
mandatory stretch provision shall be allocated such that each of the
player’s stretched protected Compensation payments in respect of the
applicable Salary Cap Year are reduced on an equal basis over the
applicable stretch period (i.e., for the first Salary Cap Year with respect to
which a player’s protected Compensation is stretched, over the entire
stretch period, and for any subsequent Salary Cap Years, over the
remaining stretch period). In no event shall a Team be entitled to set-off
under a First Contract in respect of compensation earned by a player (for
services as a player) from a Subsequent Team(s) during a Salary Cap Year
occurring after the term of the First Contract.
   (b) In the event a player’s protected Compensation for any remaining
Salary Cap Year(s) under a First Contract is stretched for cash purposes in
accordance with the mandatory stretch provision and the First Team also
elects to stretch the player’s Salary under the First Contract for Salary Cap
purposes in accordance with Article VII, Section 7(d)(5), then the set-off
amount in respect of each remaining Salary Cap Year(s) covered by the
term of the First Contract that is stretched for Salary Cap purposes in
accordance with Article VII, Section 7(d)(5) shall be allocated equally to
reduce the player’s re-attributed Salary amounts over the applicable stretch
period in the manner described in Section 5(a) above.
   (c) The following examples are for clarity:
   (X) Assume a player has protected Compensation of $3 million in
respect of the 2017-18 Season and is being paid by the First Team at a rate
of $1 million over three Seasons in accordance with the mandatory stretch
provision and the amount of set-off to which the First Team is entitled
under this Article XXVII with respect to the 2017-18 Season is $600,000,
then the $600,000 set-off amount would be allocated to each of the three
(3) Seasons at a rate of $200,000 per Season and the $200,000 set-off for
each Season would be deducted in equal amounts from each of the player’s
protected Compensation payments during such year.
   (Y) Assume: (i) a player has remaining protected Compensation of $9
million ($3 million each for the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 Seasons,
