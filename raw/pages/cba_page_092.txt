70     Article IV
            maximum benefit amount may be adjusted for future
            increases in the cost-of-living in the manner provided under
            Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.
            (ii) Neither the pension benefits accrued nor payable to any
            player or beneficiary for a Plan Year shall exceed the
            maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the
            regulations issued thereunder), as in effect as of the effective
            date of this Agreement, as adjusted in accordance with the
            actuarial factors specified in the Pension Plan, and as may be
            adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the
            manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.
            (iii) If all or any portion of the actuarially-determined annual
            contributions to be made to the Pension Plan would not be
            fully deductible under the Code when paid to the Pension
            Plan, the New Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount
            which would result in all of such contributions being fully-
            deductible when paid. In the event that any such contribution
            or portion thereof is not fully deductible when paid, the NBA
            and the Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with
            respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the
            NBA Teams to the players. The costs of any such alternative
            arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an
            after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but
            no greater than the annual accrual cost that such Teams would
            have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the amount by
            which the New Monthly Benefit is reduced pursuant to this
            Section 1(a)(4)(iii). If despite good faith negotiations, the
            NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to
            an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to
            agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally implement
            during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
            provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or
            (C) to strike.
   (b) Administration. Effective as of the effective date of this
Agreement, the NBA and the Players Association shall cause to be
amended the Pension Plan and the Agreement of Trust, by and among the
NBA Teams and certain individual Trustees, dated January 17, 1997 (the
