an unauthorized Endorsement or Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion (as
such terms are defined and clarified in Article XXVIII of the CBA and
Paragraph 14(c) above) or any right which would violate Article XXVIII,
Section 3(f) of the CBA. For purposes of clarity and without limitation,
any use of a Player’s Player Attributes that has been expressly authorized
by the Player (not including in this Contract) shall not be an unauthorized

    15. TEAM DEFAULT.
    In the event of an alleged default by the Team in the payments to the
Player provided for by this Contract, or in the event of an alleged failure by
the Team to perform any other material obligation that it has agreed to
perform hereunder, the Player shall notify both the Team and the League
in writing of the facts constituting such alleged default or alleged failure. If
neither the Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or alleged
failure to be remedied within five (5) days after receipt of such written
notice, the Players Association shall, on behalf of the Player, have the right
to request that the dispute concerning such alleged default or alleged
failure be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance
with the provisions of the CBA. If, as a result of such arbitration, an
award issues in favor of the Player, and if neither the Team nor the League
complies with such award within ten (10) days after the service thereof, the
Player shall have the right, by a further written notice to the Team and the
League, to terminate this Contract.
    16. TERMINATION.

                 conduct to standards of good citizenship, good moral
                 character (defined here to mean not engaging in acts of
                 moral turpitude, whether or not such acts would constitute
                 a crime), and good sportsmanship, to keep himself in first
                 class physical condition, or to obey the Team’s training
                 rules;
