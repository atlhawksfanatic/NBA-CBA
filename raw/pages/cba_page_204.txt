                    amount payable by the Team been included in
                    Team Salary during the Salary Cap Year to which it
                    related.
            (C)     If a Grievance relates to a player’s Compensation
                    for more than one (1) Season, for purposes of
                    determining the disputed amount payable by the
                    Team with respect to each such Season following
                    the resolution of the Grievance, the aggregate
                    amounts payable to the player for all Seasons
                    pursuant to the resolution of the grievance,
                    whether by award or settlement, shall be allocated
                    to each such Season in proportion to the amount of
                    Compensation that was in dispute for such Season,
                    unless, in the case of an award, the Grievance
                    Arbitrator allocates the amounts payable to the
                    player to specific Seasons.
            (D)     Immediately upon reaching any agreement (oral or
                    written) to resolve a Grievance relating to a player’s
                    Compensation, a Team shall notify the NBA by
                    email and provide the NBA with the terms of such
                    agreement. A Team’s failure to comply with the
                    preceding sentence may be considered evidence of
                    a violation of Article XIII. If a Team delays or
                    attempts to delay in any manner the processing or
                    resolution of a Grievance relating to a player’s
                    Compensation for the purpose of creating or
                    increasing its Room in any Salary Cap Year or for
                    the purpose of reducing or deferring a tax payment
                    to the NBA, such conduct shall constitute a
                    violation of Article XIII.

            upon any agreement disclosed to the NBA pursuant to
            Article II, Section 13(a)(i) (including, without limitation,
            any executed Player Contract whose validity is conditional
            on the passage of a physical examination by the player or
            on the assignment of the Contract), except to the extent
