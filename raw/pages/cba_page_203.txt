             Year to which the Grievance relates that is
             attributable to the fifty percent (50%)
             allocation. Following resolution of the
             Grievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team
             the tax refund to which it is entitled (if any)
             based upon the resolution of the Grievance,
             and the remainder of the set aside tax funds
             shall be distributed by the NBA to one (1)
             or more Teams or otherwise used by the
             League in such manner as the NBA may
             reasonably determine, consistent with the
             provisions of Section 12(g) below.
(B) When a player initiates a Grievance against a Team
    seeking the payment of Compensation for a Season
    covered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team
    asserts is not owed, following resolution of the
    Grievance, whether by award or settlement, the
    disputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall
    be included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year
    in which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the
    extent that it had been previously excluded from
    Team Salary). Notwithstanding the preceding
    sentence: (i) a Team shall be required to pay
    additional tax to the NBA if and to the extent that,
    due to the operation of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B),
    the aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to
    Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary Cap
    Years in question (the Salary Cap Year to which the
    Grievance related and the subsequent Salary Cap
    Year in which the Grievance was resolved) is less
    than it would have been had the disputed amount
    payable by the Team been included in Team Salary
    during the Salary Cap Year to which it related; and
    (ii) a Team shall be entitled to a tax refund from the
    NBA if and to the extent that, due to the operation
    of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(B), the aggregate tax it
    pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f) below
    for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in question is
