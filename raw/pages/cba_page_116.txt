94     Article IV
       Qualified Plan. For purposes of this Section 4, a “Contribution
       Year” means each November 1 through October 31 in respect of
       which a Team Funding Pool (defined below) is provided under this
       Section 4.
       (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4(a) to the contrary,
       and subject to the requirements of the Code and IRS rules and
       regulations, if the Board of Trustees of the Post-Career Income
       Plan (the “PCIP Trustees”) determines, after Post-Career
       Annuities have been purchased for Eligible Players for a
       Contribution Year, that a present or former player should have
       received an Allocated Share for such Contribution Year but did not
       receive an Allocated Share, such present or former player shall be
       entitled to an Allocated Share equal to the amount of the Allocated
       Share made to the other Eligible Players for such Contribution
       Year, which shall be used to purchase one or more Post-Career
       Annuities in the same manner and on the same terms as the other
       Eligible Players for such Contribution Year. Unless practicable
       and otherwise agreed to by the PCIP Trustees, the cost of such
       Allocated Share shall not require a retroactive reduction in the
       Allocated Share and Post-Career Annuities of the other Eligible
       Players for such Contribution Year but rather shall be paid from
       the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season (or, to the
       extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season is
       insufficient, future Seasons). In addition, the cost of any additional
       fees or expenses charged by the Insurer for the purchase of such
       Post-Career Annuity (or for the purchase of any other Post-Career
       Annuity(ies) under the Plan on a retroactive basis) shall also be
       paid from the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season (or,
       to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season is
       insufficient, future Seasons).
   (b) Deductibility of Team Contributions/Regulatory Changes.
       (1) The Post-Career Income Plan shall be structured and
       maintained in a manner that will result in the Team Funding Pool
       being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable,
       Canadian laws) when used toward Team Contributions contributed
       to the Post-Career Income Plan. In the event that a Team is
       disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for its portion of the
