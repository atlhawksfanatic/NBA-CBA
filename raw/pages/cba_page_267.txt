                                                  Article VII  245
      alternative, if either the NBA or the Players Association
      exercises its option to terminate this Agreement following
      the 2022-23 Salary Cap Year pursuant to Article XXXIX)
      any such differences shall be debited or credited, as the
      case may be, to the Tax Level for the then-current Salary
      Cap Year, in all such cases with interest (at a rate equal to
      the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall
      Street Journal on the date of the issuance of the Interim
      Audit Report).
(vi)  In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary
      Cap Year are less than the Designated Share for such Salary
      Cap Year, then the Tax Level for the subsequent Salary
      Cap Year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall
      divided by the number of Teams in the NBA during such
      subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams
      in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
(vii) In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section
      12(a)(14) above) in any Salary Cap Year, then the Tax Level
      for the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as
      follows:
      (A)      If the amount of the Overage in the Salary Cap
               Year is equal to or less than six percent (6%) of
               Total Salaries and Benefits, then no adjustments
               shall be made to the Tax Level for the subsequent
               Salary Cap Year.
      (B)      If the amount of the Overage in the Salary Cap
               Year equals more than six percent (6%) of Total
               Salaries and Benefits, then the Tax Level for the
               subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by an
               amount to be calculated as follows:
      STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and
                  Benefits from the Overage.
      STEP 2: If Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap
                  Year does not exceed BRI for the Salary Cap
