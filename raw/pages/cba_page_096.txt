74     Article IV
   (d) Players Employed by Toronto.
       (1) Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment
       Partnership (or any successor thereto) (“Toronto”) or by an NBA
       Team located in any country other than the United States shall
       receive pension benefits of comparable value. Except as otherwise
       provided in Section 1(d)(2), players employed by Toronto
       (“Toronto Players”) shall continue to receive such benefits by
       means of the Pension Plan and a separate pension plan maintained
       by Toronto (the “Toronto Plan”); provided, however, that a player
       shall not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate) in the
       Pension Plan for any period of time during which the player is
       both a resident of Canada for income tax purposes and a Toronto
       Player (a “Canadian Resident”) but shall instead be eligible to
       receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below.
       (2) If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan
       would, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to
       Canadian provincial pension legislation and/or Canadian federal
       income tax laws (to the extent that the application of such laws
       would result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the
       NBA Teams or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto
       Plan’s failure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the
       Code or registered under Canadian provincial pension legislation
       or Canadian federal tax laws, then any obligation to establish,
       maintain or make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect of
       Toronto Players and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this Agreement
       or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall
       terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not
       impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this
       Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other
       provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
       create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of
       this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension
       benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event
       of such termination, the NBA and Players Association agree to
       bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to
       be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. Any such
       alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined
       on an after-tax basis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no
