190 Article VII
    Salary excluded from its Team Salary in accordance with this
    Section 4(h) shall be the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the
    date during such Season in which the player last played in a Regular
    Season or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the date
    during a prior Season in which the player last played in a Regular
    Season or playoff game under such Contract. Notwithstanding
    anything to the contrary in this Section 4(h)(1), a Team may not
    apply to have a player’s Salary excluded from Team Salary prior to
    the first anniversary of the date of the first Regular Season game
    that the player is on the Team’s roster under the Contract in
    question.
    (2) The determination of whether a player has suffered a career-
    ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected jointly
    by the NBA and the Players Association or, upon agreement of the
    NBA and the Players Association, a Fitness to Play Panel
    established under Article XXII. A player shall be deemed to have
    suffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is determined (i) by a
    such physician or Fitness to Play Panel that the player has an injury
    or illness that (x) prevents him from playing skilled professional
    basketball at an NBA level for the duration of his career, or (y)
    substantially impairs his ability to play skilled professional
    basketball at an NBA level and is of such severity that continuing
    to play professional basketball at an NBA level would subject the
    player to medically unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening
    or permanently disabling injury or illness, or (ii) by such Fitness to
    Play Panel that the player has an injury or illness that would create
    a materially elevated risk of death for the player under the
    procedures set forth in Article XXII, Section 11.
    (3) Notwithstanding Section 4(h)(1) and (2) above, if after a
    player’s Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with
    this Section 4(h), the player plays in twenty-five (25) NBA Regular
    Season and playoff games in any Season for any Team, the
    excluded Salary for the Salary Cap Year covering such Season and
    each subsequent Salary Cap Year shall thereupon be included in
    Team Salary of the Team from which the Salary was previously
    excluded (and if the twenty-fifth game played is a playoff game,
    then the excluded Salary shall be included in Team Salary
    retroactively as of the start of the Team’s last Regular Season
