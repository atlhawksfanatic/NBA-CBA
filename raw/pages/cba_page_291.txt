determine the 2018-19 Baseline Rookie Scale, the percentage increase (or
decrease) in the Salary Cap from the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year to the 2018-
19 Salary Cap Year would be applied); provided, however, that the
applicable “4th Year Option” and Qualifying Offer percentages shall
remain unchanged.
    (b) The Rookie Salary Scale for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 Salary Cap
Years shall be calculated by taking the Baseline Rookie Scale for that Salary
Cap Year and increasing (i) the Rookie Scale amounts therein in respect of
the 2018-19 Salary Cap Year by thirty percent (30%), and (ii) the Rookie
Scale amounts therein in respect of the 2019-20 Salary Cap Year and
