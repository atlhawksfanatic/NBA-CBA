    made to the Pension Plan, and fifty percent (50%) of the portion
    of the increase in the cost under the Pre-1965 Players’ Excess
    Benefit Plan, to fund the 2017-18 Pre-1965 Benefit Increase; and
    (3) (i)     Fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the costs
         (including, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees)
         that were approved by both an NBA designee and a Players
         Association designee as having been properly incurred in
         connection with the operation and administration of the
         Retiree Medical Plan (“Administrative Costs”), but only to the
         extent that such costs are attributable to the Current Retiree
         Group. The portion of the Administrative Costs for a Salary
         Cap Year that is attributable to the Current Retiree Group
         shall be determined by multiplying the total Administrative
         Costs for the Salary Cap Year by the “Allocation Percentage”
         (defined below) for such Salary Cap Year. The “Allocation
         Percentage,” for a Salary Cap Year, means the fraction, when
         expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the
         number of players in the Current Retiree Group who are
         enrolled in the Retiree Medical Plan on the day that is sixty
         (60) days prior to the last day of such Salary Cap Year, and the
         denominator of which is the total number of players who are
         enrolled in the Retiree Medical Plan on such date.
         (ii) Fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the premium costs
         paid to the insurer of the Retiree Medical Plan (excluding the
         participant share of premium contributions) that is
         attributable to the Current Retiree Group. Such portion of
         the premium costs shall be calculated based on the schedules
         provided by the insurer of the Retiree Medical Plan that set
         forth the monthly premium payments for each eligible retiree
         or any eligible dependent based on the applicable coverage
         level elected.
         (iii) The calculations required by this Section 10(b)(3) shall
         be performed by the actuarial/consulting firm employed by
         the Pension Plan, whose calculations shall be binding and
         conclusive; and
