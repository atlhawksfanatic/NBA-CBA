(ii)  If a Team exercises a Two-Way Player Conversion Option

(iii) To effectuate the requirements set forth above, every

      Player Conversion Option” and “Standard NBA Contract
      Conversion Option” headings, respectively:
      Two-Way Player Conversion Option: Team shall have
      the option to convert this Contract to a Two-Way Contract
      (“Two-Way Player Conversion Option”); provided,
      however, that (a) such option must be exercised prior to
      the first day of the NBA Regular Season, and (b) may not
      be exercised if it would result in a violation of Article X,
      Section 4(d) of the CBA. Team’s Two-Way Player
      Conversion Option may be exercised by providing written
      notice to Player that is either personally delivered to Player
      or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified,
      registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of
      Player or his representative with a copy to the Players
      Association and the NBA. If Team exercises the Two-Way
      Player Conversion Option, this Contract’s Exhibit 1A will
      immediately become null and void and of no further force
