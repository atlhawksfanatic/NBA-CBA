      (1) Subject to the rules set forth in Section 6(m) below, a Team
      may, in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 6(c), sign
      or acquire one Replacement Player to replace a player who, as a
      result of a Disabling Injury or Illness (as defined below), is unable
      to render playing services (the “Disabled Player”).
      (i)      An application for a Disabled Player Exception in respect
               of a Salary Cap Year, regardless of when the Disabling
               Injury or Illness occurred, may be made at any time from
               July 1 through January 15 of such Salary Cap Year.
      (ii)     If a Team wishes to sign a Replacement Player pursuant to
               this Section 6(c), such Replacement Player’s Contract may
               be for one Season and provide Salary and Unlikely Bonuses
               for the Salary Cap Year in which the player is signed
               totaling up to the lesser of (A) fifty percent (50%) of the
               Disabled Player’s Salary for the then-current Salary Cap
               Year, or (B) an amount equal to Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level
               Salary Exception (as defined in Section 6(e) below) for
               such Salary Cap Year.
      (iii)    If a Team wishes to acquire a Replacement Player pursuant
               to this Section 6(c), the Replacement Player must have only
               one Season remaining on his Player Contract and the
               Replacement Player’s post-assignment Salary for the Salary
               Cap Year in which the Replacement Player is acquired may
               be up to the lesser of the amount described in Section
               6(c)(1)(ii)(A) above or the amount described in Section
               6(c)(1)(ii)(B) above, plus, in either case, $100,000.
      (2) For purposes of this Section 6(c), Disabling Injury or Illness
      means any injury or illness that, in the opinion of the physician
      described in Section 6(c)(4) below, makes it substantially more
      likely than not that the player would be unable to play through the
      following June 15.
      (3) The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness shall expire on
      the March 10 following the date the Exception is granted.
