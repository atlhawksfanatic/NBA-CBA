   manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully
   deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
   income tax laws) when paid to the Health and Welfare Benefit
   Trust (or directly to an insurance carrier for a benefit provided
   under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan). If any Team is
   disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions,
   and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to
   provide the benefit (or portion of the benefit under the Health and
   Welfare Benefit Plan to which the contribution relates) and to
   make further contributions to provide the benefit (or portion of
   the benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan to which the
   contribution relates) shall immediately terminate and the provisions
   of Section 3(d)(3) shall apply.
   (2) In the event that any benefit under the Health and Welfare
   Benefit Plan is no longer permissible or available due to applicable
   laws (a “Regulatory Change”), the obligation to provide the benefit
   shall immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3)
   shall apply.
   (3) Any termination of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan or a
   benefit under such plan pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) shall not
   impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this
   Agreement, or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other
   provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it
   create any right (i) to unilaterally implement, during the term of
   this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of the Health
   and Welfare Benefit Plan (or the applicable benefit provided or to
   be provided); (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of any
   termination pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) of the Health and
   Welfare Benefit Plan or a benefit under such plan, the NBA and
   Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to
   alternative arrangement(s) to be provided by the NBA Teams to
   the players; provided, however, that any such alternative
   arrangement(s) shall be subject to the terms and conditions set
   forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect
   to an alternative arrangement to the Retiree Medical Plan, the
   terms and conditions set forth in Section 3(a)(6). The annual cost
   incurred by the NBA Teams in connection with any such
   alternative arrangement(s) (as determined on an after-tax basis)
