Salary Cap Year is less than the applicable Minimum Team Salary
for that Salary Cap Year, the NBA shall cause such Team to make
payments to the players who were on the Team’s roster during the
Regular Season covered by such Salary Cap Year equal to the
shortfall (to be disbursed to such players pro rata or in accordance

completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year. The
NBA shall cause the Team to make the required payments, less all
amounts required to be withheld by any governmental authority,
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the proposed distribution
from the Players Association in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

        player’s Salary in respect of such Player Contract for the
        applicable Salary Cap Year shall be allocated as follows: (Y)
        the amount to be included in Team Salary for each such
        Team other than the last Team by which the player was
        employed under the same Player Contract shall equal the
        Salary in respect of the Player Contract for the applicable
