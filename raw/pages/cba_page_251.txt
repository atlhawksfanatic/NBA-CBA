                                                      Article VII     229
    another Team concerning the signing of the amendment and
    subsequent trade of the amended Contract; provided, however,
    that: (i) no such agreement may be made during the period from
    the last day of the last Regular Season covered by the Contract (or
    the last day of any Regular Season that could be the last Regular
    Season covered by the Contract based upon the exercise or non-
    exercise of an Option or ETO) through the following June 30; and
    (ii) no such Extension entered into pursuant to this Section 8(e)(2)
    may cover more than three (3) Seasons from the date the
    Extension is signed. The Salary and Unlikely Bonuses that may be
    provided in the first year of the extended term and annual increases
    and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by
    Section 7(a)(3)(iii) and Section 5(c)(4) above.
    (3) A Player Contract or Extension entered into pursuant to
    Section 8(e)(1) or (2) above may not contain an Exhibit 6 thereto.
    However, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit the Teams
    involved in the trade from agreeing that the trade (and thus the
    validity of the Player Contract or Extension) will be conditional
    upon the passage of a physical examination to be performed by a
    physician designated by the assignee-Team in accordance with
    NBA procedures.
(f) (i)      In the event a player enters into an Extension pursuant to
             Section 7(a) above (other than a Designated Veteran Player
             Extension governed by Section (f)(ii) below) that covers
             four (4) or more Seasons and/or provides for Salary and
             Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the player’s Salary
             and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the amounts permissible
             in connection with Extensions entered in connection with
             an agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to Section
             8(e)(2) above, the player may not be traded before six (6)
             months following the date on which such Extension was
             signed. If a team acquires a player in a trade, then, for a
             period of six (6) months following the date of the trade, the
             team may not enter into an Extension with the player that
             provides for four (4) or more Seasons and/or provides for
             Salary and Unlikely Bonuses or annual increases in the
             player’s Salary and/or Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the
             amounts permissible in connection with Extensions
