    accounting) and in accordance with United States Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles. By way of example, and not
    limitation, in the event a team receives a signing bonus in
    consideration for its agreement to enter into a five (5) year contract
    for the local telecast of its games, such signing bonus shall be
    amortized in equal annual amounts over the five (5) Salary Cap
    Years covered by such television contract.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and
    premium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period for
    any lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.
    (3) Any payments that constitute BRI and that are subject to
    being repaid to the payor under certain circumstances (the
    “Contingencies”) shall constitute BRI in the Salary Cap Year in
    which such payments would have been earned but for the
    Contingencies unless, at the time of such payments, the
    Contingencies under which the payments would be repaid are likely
    to occur, in which case the payments will not be included in BRI
    unless and until such time as the Contingencies under which such
    repayments would be made do not occur or are not likely to occur.
    In the event that a payment that has been included in BRI is
    subsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such
    repayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is
    made.      In any proceeding commenced before the System
    Arbitrator relating to the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA
    will bear the burden of demonstrating that the applicable
    Contingencies are likely to occur.
         (i) With respect to lump sum payments (e.g., signing
         bonuses) that constitute BRI and are received by a Team or
         Related Party under agreements entered into by a Team or
         Related Party after June 30, 2017, for the period, if any,
         between (x) the date when the lump sum payment is received
         and (y) the beginning of the Salary Cap Year when the
         amortization period for the lump sum payment begins
         pursuant to Section 1(b)(1) above, BRI shall include in each
         applicable Salary Cap Year during this period imputed interest
         on the amount of such lump sum payment at a rate equal to
         the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall
