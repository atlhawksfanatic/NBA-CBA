58      Article II
                the specified services with respect to one or more off-
                seasons, the amounts paid to the player shall continue to be
                treated as a bonus for the player’s participation in an off-
                season summer league or off-season skill and/or
                conditioning program and shall continue to be subject to
                the rules in this Agreement relating to such bonuses.
         (iii)  If a Uniform Player Contract contains a bonus to be paid
                as a result of the player’s attendance at and participation in
                an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill
                and/or conditioning program, the Team shall be required
                to provide the player with a reasonable opportunity to earn
                the bonus by, for example, providing the player with the
                dates, times, and location(s) at which the specified services
                are to be performed. A Team’s failure to comply with this
                requirement with respect to any off-season shall be deemed
                to constitute a waiver of the requirement that the player
                perform the specified services for such off-season.
         (iv)   No Player Contract may provide for bonuses for any
                Season to be paid as a result of the player’s attendance at
                and participation in an off-season summer league and/or
                an off-season skill and/or conditioning program that
                exceed twenty percent (20%) of the player’s Base
                Compensation for such Season.
   (c) No Uniform Player Contract may contain a bonus for the player
being on a Team’s roster as of a specified date or for a specified duration,
or for the player dressing in uniform for or being eligible to play in a
specified number of games.
   (d) If a Player Contract contains Incentive Compensation, a Team and
player shall not be permitted at any time to amend the Contract to modify
the conditions that the player must satisfy in order to earn all or any
portion of such Incentive Compensation.
