                                                         Article XXVII     377
respectively); (ii) the First Team requested waivers on the player on
September 5, 2017 and his Contract was terminated on September 7, 2017;
(iii) the player signed a player contract with Subsequent Team A that
provides for a term covering the 2017-18 through 2018-19 Seasons; and
(iv) the set-off amount to which the First Team is entitled under this
Article XXVII in respect of the player’s contract with Subsequent Team A
is as follows: $600,000 in respect of the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year and
$600,000 in respect of the 2018-19 Salary Cap Year. (There would be no
set-off amount under the First Contract in respect of the 2019-20 Salary
Cap Year given these facts because the term of the contract with
Subsequent Team A does not cover the 2019-20 Season.) Under these
facts: (i) with respect to the 2017-18 Season, the player’s $3 million of
protected Compensation under the First Contract would be reduced by the
applicable $600,000 set-off amount and his reduced protected
Compensation amount of $2.4 million would be payable in accordance
with the payment schedule set forth in the First Contract; (ii) with respect
to the 2018-19 Season, the player’s remaining protected Compensation of
$6 million in respect of the 2018-19 and 2019-20 Seasons would be paid by
the First Team at a rate of $1.2 million over five Seasons in accordance
with the mandatory stretch provision, and his aggregate remaining
protected Compensation would be reduced by the applicable $600,000 set-
off amount such that each of the player’s stretched protected
Compensation payments in respect of the 2018-19 Season are reduced on
an equal basis over the five-year stretch period (i.e., $120,000 per year over
the 2018-19 through 2022-23 Salary Cap Years).
     (Z) Assume the same facts as in clause (Y) above and that on October
1, 2019, the player signed a player contract with Subsequent Team B
covering the 2019-20 Season and the set-off amount to which the First
Team is entitled under this Article XXVII is $500,000. In such case, the
player’s aggregate remaining protected Compensation would be further
reduced by the additional $500,000 set-off amount such that the player’s
remaining stretched protected Compensation payments in respect of the
2018-19 and 2019-20 Seasons are reduced on an equal basis over the
remaining four-year stretch period (i.e., $125,000 per year over the 2019-20
through 2022-23 Salary Cap Years).
