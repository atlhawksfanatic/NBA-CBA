                                                 Article VII    179
      Contract, the aggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding
      the payment schedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the
      then-current and each remaining Salary Cap Year on the
      basis of the remaining unearned protected Compensation
      in each such Salary Cap Year at the time of retirement.
(iii) Amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or
      settlements of, grievances between a player and a Team
      concerning Compensation obligations under a Player
      Contract in accordance with the following rules (which,
      except for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(C) below, shall be
      applied with respect to each Season for which there is any
      Compensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to
      such Season):
      (A)     (1)    When a player initiates a Grievance (as
                     defined in Article XXXI) against a Team
                     seeking the payment of Compensation for a
                     Season covered by the current or any future
                     Salary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not
                     owed, fifty percent (50%) of the disputed
                     amount shall be included in Team Salary for
                     the Salary Cap Year to which the grievance
                     relates. If the Grievance is resolved during
                     or prior to the Salary Cap Year to which it
                     relates, following resolution of the
                     Grievance, whether by award or settlement,
                     the disputed amount payable by the Team
                     in excess of the fifty percent (50%)
                     allocation shall be included in Team Salary
                     for the Salary Cap Year to which the
                     Grievance relates, or, alternatively, the
                     amount by which the fifty percent (50%)
                     allocation exceeds the disputed amount
                     payable by the Team shall be subtracted
                     from Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year
                     to which the Grievance relates.
              (2)    If a Grievance described in the first
                     sentence of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(1) above
