            5(d)(iii) below, the Offer Sheet may provide for Salary for
            the third Salary Cap Year of up to the maximum amount
            that the player would have been eligible to receive for the
            third Salary Cap Year, absent the restriction in the first
            sentence of Section 5(d)(i) above and had the player’s
            Salary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years been the
            maximum amount permitted under Article II, Section 7(a)
            and Article VII, Section 5(d)(1). If the Offer Sheet
            provides for Salary for the third Salary Cap Year in
            accordance with the foregoing sentence, then, subject to
            Section 5(d)(iii) below, (A) the player’s Salary for the fourth
            Salary Cap Year may increase or decrease in relation to the
            third Salary Cap Year’s Salary by no more than four and
            five tenths percent (4.5%) of the Salary for the third Salary
            Cap Year, (B) the Offer Sheet cannot contain bonuses of
            any kind, and (C) the Offer Sheet must provide for one
            hundred percent (100%) of the Base Compensation in each
            Season to be protected for lack of skill and injury or illness
            (with no individually-negotiated conditions or limitations
            on such protection).
     (iii)  If a Team extends an Offer Sheet in accordance with
            Section 5(d)(ii) above, then, for purposes of determining
            whether the Team has Room for the Offer Sheet, the
            Salary for the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer
            Sheet shall be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate
            Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each subsequent
            Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet. If the ROFR
            Team does not exercise its Right of First Refusal, the
            player’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the
            Contract with the Team that extended the Offer Sheet shall
            be deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for
            each such Salary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team exercises
            its Right of First Refusal, the player’s Salary for each Salary
            Cap Year covered by the Contract with the ROFR Team
            shall be the Salary for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in
            the Contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if
            the sum of: (i) the ROFR Team’s Team Salary at the time it
            exercises its Right of First Refusal; and (ii) the average of
            the aggregate Salaries for each Salary Cap Year of the Offer
