            Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and Article
            IV, Section 9 for the Salary Cap Year that commenced on
            the immediately preceding July 1, then the Tax Level for
            the Salary Cap Year that commenced on such immediately
            preceding July 1 will be calculated using Interim Projected
            BRI instead of Projected BRI, Estimated BRI instead of
            BRI and Estimated Benefits instead of Benefits for all
            purposes under this Section 12(a)(17) including, without
            limitation, the adjustments set forth in Section 12(a)(17)(vi)
            or (vii) below. In the event that the Interim Audit Report
            for a Salary Cap Year has not been completed as of the last
            day of the Moratorium Period immediately following the
            end of such Salary Cap Year, and the NBA and Players
            Association have not reached agreement on Projected BRI
            and Projected Benefits pursuant to Section 1 above and
            Article IV, Section 9, then the Tax Level for the Salary Cap
            Year that commenced on the immediately preceding July 1
            shall, until such Interim Audit Report is completed, be an
            amount that would have been the Tax Level for the
            preceding Salary Cap Year had Projected BRI or Interim
            Projected BRI, as the case may be, for such preceding
            Salary Cap Year included, with respect to the NBAâ€™s
            national broadcast, national telecast or network cable
            television contracts, the rights fees or other non-contingent
            payments stated in such contracts for the Season following
            the Season covered by such preceding Salary Cap Year
            instead of for the Season covered by such preceding Salary
            Cap Year.
    (v)     In the event that the Tax Level for a Salary Cap Year is
            calculated in accordance with Section 12(a)(17)(iv) above
            (i.e., is based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior
            Salary Cap Year) and BRI and Benefits as set forth in the
            Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year are different
            from those in the Interim Audit Report such that the Tax
            Level would have been different from that based upon the
            Interim Audit Report, any such difference in the Tax Level
            shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the Tax
