                                                   Article VII     139
(xx)    Any thing of value received from a concessionaire, food
        service vendor or other third party equipment or service
        provider that, if received in kind, is installed in an NBA
        arena or, if received in cash, is directed to defraying the
        costs of the construction or substantial renovation of an
        NBA arena; and
(xxi)   Proceeds from businesses outside the arena (e.g.,
        restaurants, casinos, hotels, retail businesses, etc.), except
        for revenues otherwise included in BRI for Team-identified
        stores. For clarity, the foregoing exclusion will not apply to
        revenues from the business operations of the NBA
        basketball team that are otherwise includable as BRI under
        other provisions of this Agreement, including, without
        limitation, revenues received from sales of Team game
        tickets, media rights, sponsorships, signage outside the
        arena (subject to the limitations set forth in Section
        1(a)(1)(vi) above), and arena plaza game-day sales of
        novelties and concessions (subject to the limitations set
        forth in Section 1(a)(1)(v) above).
(3) The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category or
source of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI: (A) consideration
shall be given to whether such category or source is more similar in
kind or nature to the included categories and sources listed in
Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xvii) above, on the one hand, or to the
excluded categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through
(xxi) above, on the other; and, (B) no inference may be drawn from
the fact that such category or source was not included in the
categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xvii)
above, or the fact that such category or source was not included in
the categories and sources listed in Sections 1(a)(2)(i) through (xxi)
above; and (ii) in any proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the
includability or categorization of any revenue or expense item for
BRI purposes; (B) the amount to be included in or deducted from
BRI with respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the
accounting methodology used by the Accountants in connection
with any audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of
the parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit
Reports for any of the 1999-2000 through 2015-16 Salary Cap
