                                                        Article VII       165
                    If Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap
                    Year exceeds BRI for the Salary Cap Year by
                    more than eight percent (8%) of BRI for the
                    Salary Cap Year and the amount of the Overage
                    described above does not exceed nine percent
                    (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then proceed
                    to Step 3.
         STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the Salary Cap Year from
                    Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap
                    Year.
         STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8%) of BRI for the Salary
                    Cap Year from the result of Step 3.
         STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by forty-four and
                    seventy-four one hundredths percent (44.74%).
         STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result of
                    Step 1. If the result of this step is less than zero,
                    then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary
                    Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no
                    further steps are required.
         STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number of
                    Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary
                    Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their
                    first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The
                    result of this calculation is the amount of the
                    reduction in the Salary Cap for such subsequent
                    Salary Cap Year.
Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2013-14 Season are
$2.27 billion and the Designated Share is $2.1 billion resulting in an Overage
of $170 million (which equals 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits). Assume
Projected BRI for the 2014-15 Season ($4.41 billion) exceeds actual BRI for
the 2013-14 Season ($4.2 billion) by 5%. Assume there are 30 Teams in
the NBA in 2014-15. The Salary Cap for the 2014-15 Season would be
reduced by $1.1 million ((7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits ($170 million)
less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits ($136 million)) divided by 30).
