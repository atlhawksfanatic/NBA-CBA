       Section 1(a)(1)(xii). The NBA will work in good faith to
       secure access to appropriate third-party books and records
       in the event the parties agree, or it is determined by an
       arbitrator, that a sale/transfer of BRI has occurred or been
       agreed to in accordance with this Section 1(a)(1)(xii). In any
       dispute over the value of BRI sold/transferred, subject to
       an arbitrator’s determinations of admissibility and
       relevance, neither party shall be barred from seeking to rely
       on the terms of the underlying transaction;

       gambling on NBA games or any aspect of NBA games,

       revenues or other amounts, if applicable, under Section
       1(a)(2) below and allocations for multi-element deals. BRI

       expenses related thereto, subject to Section 1(a)(6) below,

       that in no event shall such expenses cause the amount
       included in BRI relating to the championship parade to be
       less than zero (0) for any Salary Cap Year;
(xv)   Fifty percent (50%) of the gross proceeds, net of fifty
       percent (50%) of reasonable and customary expenses
