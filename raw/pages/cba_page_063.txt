The player and Team may provide in a Rookie Scale Extension that the
Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the extended term will be
increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that
comply with Article VII, Section 5(c). In the case of a Rookie Scale
Extension entered into pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above, the player and Team
may instead provide that Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of
the extended term will be increased or decreased by a different percentage
based on the percentage of the Salary Cap that the player receives in Salary
in the first Season of the extended term. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, a Designated Rookie Scale Player Extension
must provide for annual increases in Salary for each Season following the
first Season of the extended term equal to eight percent (8%) of Salary for
the Salary Cap Year covered by the first Season of the extended term. Any
such Rookie Scale Extension (including any such Designated Rookie Scale
Player Extension) shall be deemed amended on July 1 of the Salary Cap
Year covering the first Season of the extended term to provide for specific
Salaries for each Season of the extended term, based on the Maximum
Annual Salary applicable to such player on such July 1. A Rookie Scale
Extension entered into pursuant to this subsection may not include any
Incentive Compensation.
    (e) A player and a Team may provide in a Designated Veteran Player
Extension that the player’s Salary (in the first Season of the extended term)

indicated in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage that is agreed
upon by the Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less
than thirty percent (30%) or greater than thirty-five percent (35%). The
player and Team may provide in a Designated Veteran Player Extension
