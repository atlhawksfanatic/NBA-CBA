            purchased and sold on a nationally recognized secondary
            market (e.g., without limitation on any example, shares in
            “Facebook” as of the date of the 2011 CBA), and in each
            case under (x) and (y), any contractual or other prohibition
            or limitation on sale would not preclude a sale; (B)
            “Publicly Traded Value” means the weighted average daily
            trading price of the applicable equity securities for the
            thirty (30) trading days (x) preceding the date of receipt if
            the securities are Publicly Tradable prior to that date or (y)
            following the date they become Publicly Tradable; provided
            that if such equity securities are sold during the Salary Cap
            Year in which their Publicly Traded Value is first included
            in BRI, the “Publicly Traded Value” of such equity
            securities shall be the Net Proceeds from such sale; (C)
            “Net Proceeds” means the proceeds received by the selling
            entity from the applicable sale, net of commissions and
            reasonable expenses relating to such sale, any exercise or
            conversion price with respect to securities resulting from
            the exercise or conversion of contingent securities, and any
            applicable taxes of the selling entity (or if the selling entity
            is a pass-through entity for income tax purposes, such
            entity’s owners), which shall be determined using a tax rate
            equivalent to the highest marginal combined federal, state
            and local tax rate that would be applicable in the locale
            where the principal place of business of the selling entity is
            located, which in the case of a Team or a Related Party of a
            Team shall be deemed to be the locale of the arena in
            which the Team plays more than one-half of its Regular
            Season home games; and (D) a sale of equity securities shall
            not be subject to inclusion in BRI if the sale is part of a
            larger transaction in which (x) BRI has been fully
            accounted for or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of
            an NBA-related entity or business unit thereof are sold and
            such equity securities do not represent a majority of the
            value in such transaction. In all cases, the Publicly Traded
            Value of, or Net Proceeds from, the applicable equity
            securities will be included in BRI over a seven (7) year
            amortization period (inclusive of the Salary Cap Year in
            which such Publicly Traded Value is first included in BRI),
