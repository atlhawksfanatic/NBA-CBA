                                                   Article VII    209
         Replacement Player(s) are acquired may not exceed one
         hundred percent (100%) of the pre-trade Salary of the
         Traded Player at the time the Traded Player’s Contract was
         traded, plus $100,000.
(iii)    A Team may aggregate the pre-trade Salaries in two (2) or
         more Player Contracts for the purpose of acquiring in a
         simultaneous trade one (1) or more Replacement Players
         whose post-trade Salaries, in the aggregate, are no more
         than an amount equal to: for Teams whose post-
         assignment Team Salary would exceed the Tax Level for
         the then-current Salary Cap Year, one hundred twenty-five
         percent (125%) of the pre-trade aggregated Salaries of the
         Traded Players, plus $100,000; and for Teams whose post-
         assignment Team Salary would be equal to or less than the
         Tax Level for the then-current Salary Cap Year, the greater
         of: (y) the lesser of: (A) one hundred seventy-five (175%)
         of the pre-trade aggregated Salaries of the Traded Players,
         plus $100,000; or (B) one hundred percent (100%) of the
         pre-trade aggregated Salaries of the Traded Players, plus $5
         million; or (z) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of
         the pre-trade aggregated Salaries of the Traded Players, plus
         $100,000. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no
         Player Contract acquired pursuant to an Exception may,
         for a period of two (2) months from the date the Player
         Contract is acquired, be aggregated with any other Contract
         for purposes of a trade. For example, if a player were
         traded to a Team pursuant to an Exception on December
         20, 2017, then the player’s Contract could not be
         aggregated with any other Contract for purposes of a trade
         until February 20, 2018.
(2) Except       as provided in Section 6(j)(3) below, and
notwithstanding Section 6(m) below, a Team with a Team Salary
below the Salary Cap may acquire one (1) or more players by
assignment whose post-assignment Salaries, in the aggregate, are
no more than an amount equal to the Team’s Room plus $100,000.
(3) In lieu of conducting the trade in accordance with Section
6(j)(2) above, and notwithstanding Section 6(m) below and subject
