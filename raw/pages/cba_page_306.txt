                  Contract; or (y) Base Compensation (with no

                  Qualifying Offer applicable to the fifteenth player
                  selected in the first round of the Draft (the
                  “fifteenth player”) as called for by the Rookie
                  Salary Scale applicable to the First Round Pick’s
                  Rookie Scale Contract. For purposes of calculating
                  such Qualifying Offer amount, the Fourth Year
                  Salary of the fifteenth player shall be deemed to
                  equal one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the
                  Rookie Scale Amount applicable to the fifteenth
                  player.
