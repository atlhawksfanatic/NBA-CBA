  (b) (i)      In the event that a First-Year Player tests positive for a
               Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 6, he shall
               immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any
               association with the NBA or its Teams for a period of one
               (1) year, his Player Contract shall be rendered null and void
               and of no further force or effect (subject to the provisions
               of paragraph 8 of the Uniform Player Contract), and he
               shall enter Stage 1 of the Drugs of Abuse Program. Such
               dismissal and disqualification shall be mandatory and may
               not be rescinded or reduced by the playerâ€™s Team or the
               NBA; provided, however, that such dismissal and
               disqualification, may be reduced or rescinded by the
               Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with Section 19 below.
        (ii)   During any period while a First-Year Player is dismissed
               and disqualified from the NBA under Section 6(b)(i) above,
               and so long as such player is in compliance with his in-
               patient or aftercare obligations under the Program (as
               determined by the Medical Director), he shall receive from
               his Team a reasonable and necessary living expense stipend
               to be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association
               which (A) shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
               the Salary that the player would otherwise have been
               entitled to earn for the period of his dismissal and
               disqualification and (B) shall not be payable for more than
               one (1) year from the date of such dismissal and
               disqualification.
        (iii)  Any First-Year Player who tests positive for marijuana or a
               SPED pursuant to this Section 6, shall suffer the applicable
               consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case
               may be. Any First-Year Player who tests positive for a
               Diuretic pursuant to this Section 6 shall be deemed to have
               tested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable
               consequences set forth in Section 9 below.
