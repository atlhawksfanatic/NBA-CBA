       TRAVEL ACCOMMODATIONS, LOCKER ROOM
                      FACILITIES AND PARKING
Section 1.      Hotel Arrangements.
    (a) Each Team agrees to use its best efforts to make the following
arrangements for its players while they are “on the road”:
          (i)     to have their baggage picked up by porters;
          (ii)    to have them stay in first class hotels; and
          (iii)   to have extra-long beds available to them in each hotel.
If there is a finding that a Team has committed a willful violation of this
Section 1(a), the NBA shall impose a $5,000 fine on such Team.
    (b) When its players are “on the road,” each Team shall provide an
individual hotel room for each player.
Section 2.      First Class Travel.
    (a) Each Team shall provide first class travel accommodations on all
trips in excess of one (1) hour, except when such accommodations are not
available; provided, however, that a Team’s head coach may fly first class
in place of a player when eight (8) or more first class seats are provided to
players. In the event a Team’s head coach flies first class in place of a
player, one (1) player, designated by the Players Association, shall be paid
the difference between the amount paid by such Team for a first class seat
on the flight involved and the cost of the seat purchased for such
designated player on that flight.
    (b) If there is a finding that a Team has committed a willful violation
of Section 2(a) above, the NBA shall impose a $5,000 fine on such Team.
