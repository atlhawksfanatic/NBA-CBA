                                                            Exhibit F      F-3
Expert Representative(s) needed to serve on the Policy Committee. If they
are unable to do so, then, within an additional three-day period, the Party
Representatives shall engage in a process of alternatively striking names
from the lists until one name remains for each open position, and such
person(s) shall be appointed as the Expert Representative(s).
Training and Education
    The Parties seek to prevent incidents of domestic violence, sexual
assault, and child abuse from occurring through educational programs and
awareness training.
    The Policy Committee will implement and oversee all training and
educational programs for NBA players that address issues of domestic
violence, sexual assault, and child abuse, and shall make all determinations
related thereto including, but not limited to, the staffing, content, format,
and frequency of such programs. The Policy Committee will annually
review such programs to ensure that they are effective and that the content
is appropriate, thorough, and properly communicated to the players.
Hotline
    Within 60 days of the issuance of this Policy, the Parties shall jointly
select a service provider to support a 24-hour, confidential hotline that can
be used by players, their families, and other victims of domestic violence,
sexual assault, and child abuse as defined by this Policy to seek assistance
and referrals (the “Service Provider”).
    If the Parties are unable to do so, then, within five days following the
deadline to select the Service Provider, they shall exchange lists containing
the names, qualifications, and cost of three proposed Service Providers.
Within five days following the exchange of such lists, the Parties shall
jointly select the Service Provider. If the Parties are unable to do so, then,
within an additional three-day period, they shall engage in a process of
alternatively striking names from the lists until one name remains, and
such organization shall be appointed as the Service Provider.
