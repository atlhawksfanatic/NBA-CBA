206     Article VII
        (5) In the event that a Team uses the Non-Taxpayer Mid-level
        Salary Exception in order to sign one (1) or more new Player
        Contracts during a Salary Cap Year, not to exceed three (3) Seasons
        in length that, in the aggregate, provide for Salaries and Unlikely
        Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year of the Contract(s) totaling no
        more than the amounts set forth in Section 6(f)(2) above, and, but
        for the Team’s use of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
        Exception as described above, the Team otherwise would be
        permitted to engage in a transaction that causes the Team’s Team
        Salary to exceed the Tax Level for such Salary Cap Year plus the
        Tax Apron Amount in accordance with the rules set forth in this
        Article VII, then the Team shall be permitted to engage in such
        transaction, whereupon the Team will be deemed to have used the
        Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer
        Mid-Level Salary Exception for all purposes under this Article VII,
        and the Team’s ability to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
        Exception during such Salary Cap Year shall thereupon be
        extinguished.
   (g) Mid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams. Subject to the
rules set forth in Section 6(m) below:
        (1) In the event (i) a Team’s Team Salary at any time during a
        Salary Cap Year is below the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year
        such that the Team is not entitled to use the Bi-annual Exception,
        Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, or Taxpayer Mid-Level
        Salary Exception, and (ii) at the time the Team proposes to use the
        Mid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams, the Team has not
        already used either the Bi-annual Exception, the Non-Taxpayer
        Mid-Level Salary Exception, or the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary
        Exception in that same Salary Cap Year, then the Team may at
        such time use the Mid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams to
        sign one (1) or more Player Contracts, not to exceed two (2)
        Seasons in length, that, in the aggregate, provide for Salaries and
        Unlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year totaling up to the
        amounts set forth below:
