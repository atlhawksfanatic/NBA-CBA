                                                            Article IV        97
        term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of
        post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to
        strike.
        (5) In the event of a termination described in Sections 4(b)(2)-(4),
        the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith
        with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the
        NBA Teams to the players. The annual cost to the Teams of any
        such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis)
        shall be substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost
        that such Teams would have incurred under the Post-Career
        Income Plan on the date of termination. The cost of funding of
        any such alternative arrangement shall be as set forth in Section
        4(d)(1). If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the
        Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative
        arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not
        create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this
        Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-
        employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
   (c) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the Post-Career
Income Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on
a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however,
that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the Post-Career Income
Plan for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident
but shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in
Section 7 below. If the NBA and the Players Association should
determine that the Post-Career Income Plan cannot continue to be
provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian
federal income tax laws or that either the Qualified Plan or the Non-
Qualified Plan would become subject to Ontario’s Pension Benefits Act,
the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with
respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto to the
Toronto Players. The cost of any such alternative arrangement to be
provided in any Contribution Year shall come from such year’s Team
Funding Pool and shall equal an Eligible Player’s Allocated Share for such
Contribution Year as reduced by all federal, state, local, payroll or other tax
obligations of any kind (including, where applicable, Canadian tax)
applicable to such player as Toronto, in the exercise of its reasonable
discretion, deems necessary. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA
