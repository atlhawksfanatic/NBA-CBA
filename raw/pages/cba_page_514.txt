or email either before conclusion of the trade call with the NBA or as soon
as possible after the conclusion of the trade call (but in no event may such
notification be made more than one (1) hour after the conclusion of the

received (if the assignment is made between Seasons), or within such
longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. The NBA

practicable but in no event later than one (1) business day after such
assignment occurs. The Player further agrees that, immediately upon
reporting to the assignee Team, he will submit upon request to a physical
examination conducted by a physician designated by the assignee Team.
   (d) If the Player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the
Team to which this Contract has been assigned within the time provided in
subsection (c) above, then (i) upon consummation of the assignment, the
Player may be disciplined by the assignee Team or, if the assignment is not
consummated or is voided as a result of the Playerâ€™s failure to so report, by
the assignor Team, and (ii) such conduct shall constitute conduct
prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution, and
shall therefore subject the Player to discipline from the NBA in accordance
with such Article.
