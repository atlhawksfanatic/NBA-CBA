62       Article II
Section 14. Void Contracts.
   If a Player Contract fails to take effect or becomes void as a result of a
Commissioner disapproval, the player’s failure to pass a physical
examination conducted pursuant to Exhibit 6 to such Contract, or the
rescission of a trade conducted pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e), then,
in each such case:
   (a) the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the
player as the Team possessed at the time of the execution of the Contract,
including, without limitation, any such rights that the Team possessed
pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(b), Article X, and Article XI;
   (b) any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that was outstanding at
the time the Contract was executed shall continue in effect as if the
Contract had not been executed (including if the original deadline for
accepting the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer expired following the
execution of the Contract), but for no fewer than six (6) business days
following the Commissioner’s disapproval, the Team’s issuance of notice
to the player that he did not pass the physical examination, or the
rescission of such trade, as the case may be; and
   (c) in the case of a player who does not pass a physical examination
pursuant to Exhibit 6: (i) the player shall not be permitted to accept such
Required Tender or Qualifying Offer for a period of two (2) business days
following his receipt of notice from the Team that he did not pass his
physical examination, during which period the Team may elect to withdraw
the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer, which shall have the
consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as
the case may be; and (ii) if the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer is not
withdrawn by the Team during this period, the Required Tender or
Qualifying Offer shall thereafter be deemed amended so as to eliminate
any Exhibit 6 that may be contained therein.
Section 15. Moratorium Period.
   Except as permitted in the next sentence, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no player and Team may enter into any oral
or written agreement concerning terms and conditions of the player’s
employment, or reduce any such agreement to writing in the form of a
Uniform Player Contract or amendment, during the Moratorium Period.
