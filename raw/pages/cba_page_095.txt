                                                          Article IV     73
        (5) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
        immediately upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i)
        the Players Association shall forfeit its right to appoint Pension
        Plan Trustees; (ii) the appointment and Trusteeship of the then-
        current Pension Plan Trustees who had been appointed by the
        Players Association shall automatically end; and (iii) sponsorship,
        administration and operation of the Pension Plan shall
        automatically revert back to the NBA. The Pension Plan shall
        again become jointly operated and administered by the NBA and
        Players Association immediately upon their entering into a new
        collective bargaining agreement, and the provisions of this Section
        1(b) shall be incorporated into such new agreement. Furthermore,
        in the event that the sponsorship and administration has reverted
        back to the NBA under this paragraph, and subject to ERISA,
        including, without limitation, ERISA’s requirements applicable to
        pension plan fiduciaries, the Trustees who are appointed by the
        NBA will continue to give due consideration to past practice,
        including past practice established during the period of joint
        administration by the NBA and Players Association, with regard to
        administrative determinations and interpretations.
   (c) Contributions/Funding. The NBA and Players Association
acknowledge and agree that the Teams shall continue at all times to
contribute to the Plan at least the amount necessary to meet the Pension
Plan’s statutory minimum funding requirements under Section 412,
Section 431 and, if applicable, Section 432 of the Code, or any other
applicable law (the “Minimum Funding Standards”) for such Plan Year, as
determined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. For any period during
the term of this Agreement during which a new “funding improvement
plan” (a “FIP”) is required to be adopted by the Pension Plan under the
Minimum Funding Standards, the funding benchmark for such FIP shall
equal the funding benchmark required by the Minimum Funding
Standards. The Teams may, in the sole discretion of the NBA, contribute
to the Pension Plan more than the amount necessary to meet the
Minimum Funding Standards; provided, however, that any such additional
contribution amount shall not be greater than the contribution amount
determined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan in accordance with the
Pension Plan’s historical scheduled contribution methodology. All
contributions shall be conditioned on their being fully deductible by the
Teams when paid.
