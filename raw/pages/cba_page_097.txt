         good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail
         to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described
         above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to
         unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any
         terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players;
