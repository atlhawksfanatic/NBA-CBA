                                                Article XIII     313
      valuation, and shall render a decision within fifteen (15)
      days following the conclusion of the hearing. Within ten
      (10) days of any decision by the business valuation expert,
      any of the parties may file an appeal with the System
      Arbitrator, who shall conduct a hearing and render a
      decision within twenty (20) days of the filing of the appeal.
      In any such proceeding, the System Arbitrator shall apply
      an “arbitrary and capricious” standard of review. There
      shall be no right of further appeal to the Appeals Panel.
(ii)  If the NBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 5,
      the difference between (A) the compensation or
      consideration received by the retired player, or the value of
      the investment or business opportunity received by the
      retired player (net of any contribution by the retired player),
      and (B) a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of
      the services or other consideration provided by the retired
      player, or a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of
      the investment or business opportunity, in each case as
      determined by the business valuation expert or the System
      Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be included in the
      Team’s Team Salary, subject to the Team’s Room and
      other Salary Cap rules, and further subject to any allocation
      over time that the business valuation expert or System
      Arbitrator determines is appropriate. In the event that any
      amount required to be included in the Team’s Team Salary
      pursuant to this subsection exceeds the Team’s Room, the
      challenged transaction or arrangement shall be rescinded
      and of no further force and effect.
(iii) If the NBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 5,
      and the retired player and the Team and/or Team Affiliate
      renegotiate or terminate the transaction, any revised terms
      of the transaction shall be promptly disclosed to the NBA
      and the Players Association, and may, at the request of the
      NBA, be re-subjected to the procedures of this Section
      5(b).
