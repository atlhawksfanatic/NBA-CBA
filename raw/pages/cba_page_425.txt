                                     Article XXXI      403
(c) The decision of the Player Discipline Arbitrator
    shall constitute full, final and complete disposition
    of the dispute, and shall be binding upon the
    player(s) and Team(s) involved and the parties to
    this Agreement. The Player Discipline Arbitrator
    shall make no public comment regarding the
    matter.
(d) The Player Discipline Arbitrator shall be selected
    by agreement between the NBA and the Players
    Association, and shall be (i) a person with
    experience in professional basketball (such as a
    former NBA coach, general manager, or player) or
    (ii) an attorney with experience as a private
    arbitrator and/or mediator. In the event that the
    NBA and the Players Association cannot agree on
    the identity of the Player Discipline Arbitrator, each
    party shall simultaneously serve upon the other a
    list of the names of five (5) individuals meeting the
    criteria set forth in this Section 9(a)(5)(d) and shall
    alternate in striking names from such list until only
    one (1) such name remains; and the individual
    whose name remains on the list shall be selected as
    the Player Discipline Arbitrator. (A coin-flip or
    such other procedure as agreed upon by the NBA
    and the Players Association shall determine which
    of such parties shall exercise the first strike.)
(e) The Player Discipline Arbitrator shall serve for the
    duration of this Agreement; provided, however,
    that as of January 1, 2018, and as of each successive
    January 1, either of the parties to this Agreement
    may discharge the Player Discipline Arbitrator by
    serving written notice upon him and upon the
    other party to this Agreement during the period
    from       November 1         through       December 1
    immediately preceding each such January 1.
(f) If the Player Discipline Arbitrator is discharged (or
    resigns), the parties shall select a successor Player
