180 Article VII
                is resolved after the conclusion of the Salary
                Cap Year to which it relates, the disputed
                amount payable by the Team related to
                such Salary Cap Year in excess of the fifty
                percent (50%) allocation shall be included
                in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year in
                which the Grievance is resolved, or,
                alternatively, the amount by which the fifty
                percent (50%) allocation exceeds the
                disputed amount payable by the Team
                related to such Salary Cap Year shall be
                subtracted from Team Salary for the Salary
                Cap Year in which the grievance is
                resolved. Notwithstanding the preceding
                sentence: (i) a Team shall be required to pay
                additional tax to the NBA if and to the
                extent that, due to the operation of this
                Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate tax it
                pays to the NBA pursuant to Section 12(f)
                below for the two (2) Salary Cap Years in
                question (the Salary Cap Year for which the
                fifty percent (50%) allocation was made and
                the subsequent Salary Cap Year in which
                the Grievance was resolved) is less than it
                would have been had the Grievance been
                resolved during the Salary Cap Year to
                which it related; and (ii) a Team shall be
                entitled to a tax refund from the NBA if
                and to the extent that, due to the operation
                of this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the
                aggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant
                to Section 12(f) below for the two (2) Salary
                Cap Years in question is greater than it
                would have been had the grievance been
                resolved during the Salary Cap Year to
                which it related. In order to facilitate any
                such required tax refund from the NBA to
                the Team, the NBA shall set aside, pending
                resolution of the Grievance, the amount of
                tax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap
