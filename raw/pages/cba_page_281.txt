                                                       Article VII     259
(ii)      Repeater Tax Rates:
                Incremental Team
                  Salary Above
                    Tax Level                  Tax Rate for Increment
          $0 – $4,999,999                   $2.50-for-$1
          $5,000,000 – $9,999,999           $2.75-for-$1
          $10,000,000 – $14,999,999         $3.50-for-$1
          $15,000,000 – $19,999,999         $4.25-for-$1
          $20,000,000 and over              Tax rates increase by $0.50
                                            for each additional
                                            $5,000,000 increment above
                                            the Tax Level (e.g., for Team
                                            Salary $20,000,000 to
                                            $24,999,999 above the Tax
                                            Level, the Tax rate is $4.75-
                                            for-$1 for that increment).
Example: In 2017-18, a Team (whose Team Salary exceeded the Tax Level
in all the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 Salary Cap Years) with Team
Salary that exceeds the Tax Level by $11 million would pay a tax of $29.75
million (i.e., $5 million times $2.50, plus $5 million times $2.75, plus $1
million times $3.50).
(2) For purposes of computing the amount of tax a Team owes:
(i) a Team’s Team Salary shall be the sum of: (A) its Team Salary as
