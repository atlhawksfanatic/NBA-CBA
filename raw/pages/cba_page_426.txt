404     Article XXXI
                        Discipline Arbitrator in accordance with the
                        procedures set forth in Section 9(a)(5)(d) above.
    (b) A dispute involving (i) a fine of more than $50,000 and/or a
suspension of more than twelve (12) games that is imposed upon a player
by the Commissioner (or his designee) for conduct on the playing court, or
(ii) an action taken by the Commissioner (or his designee) that (A)
concerns the preservation of the integrity of, or the maintenance of public
confidence in, the game of basketball and (B) results in a financial impact
on the player of more than $50,000, shall be processed and determined in
the same manner as a Grievance under Sections 2-7 above; provided,
however, that the Grievance Arbitrator shall apply an “arbitrary and
capricious” standard of review.
    (c) (i)     As used in this Agreement, “conduct on the playing court”
                shall mean conduct in any area within an arena (including,
                but not limited to, locker rooms, vomitories, loading docks,
                and other back-of-house and underground areas, including
                those used by television production and other vehicles), at,
                during or in connection with an NBA Exhibition, All-Star,
                Regular Season or Playoff game. (By way of example and
                not limitation, conduct “at” and/or “in connection with”
                an NBA game shall include conduct engaged in by a player
                within an arena from the time the player arrives at the
                arena for an NBA game until the time the player has left
                the premises of the arena following the conclusion of such
                game.) Conduct engaged in by a player outside an arena
                such as, for example, in a parking lot adjacent to an arena,
                shall not constitute “conduct on the playing court.”
         (ii)   As used in this Agreement, “in-game conduct involving
                another player” shall mean conduct occurring during the
                course of an NBA Exhibition, All-Star, Regular Season or
                Playoff Game that is exclusively between or among players
                (and not, for example, involving in any manner a referee,
                fan, or coach) and that takes place on or adjacent to the
                playing floor (including the area of the benches), and shall
                include, but not be limited to, fights, altercations, flagrant
                fouls, and other similar conduct.
