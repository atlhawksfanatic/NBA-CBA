A-8      Exhibit A
session, provided that if the player does not initially plan to continue
working with any such Third-Party Trainer for five (5) or more sessions,
such notice must be provided no later than prior to the fifth such session.
This notice requirement shall not apply to workouts or training that
exclusively involve jogging, road bicycling, swimming, yoga, Pilates and/or
dance; and the Player’s failure to comply with such notice requirement
shall not itself constitute a material breach of this Contract. For clarity
with respect to counting multi-day training or workout sessions under this
paragraph, any such session(s) shall be counted to equal the number of
days on which such training or workouts occurred. Subject to the Team’s
other rights, and the player’s other obligations, under the CBA and this
Contract, including, for example, the player’s obligations under this
Paragraph 7 to report in good physical condition and to submit to
treatment and rehabilitation specified by a physician designated by the
Team, a player will have the right in the off-season to work out with one
or more Third-Party Trainers of his choosing and may not be disciplined
for exercising that right.
   (i) If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure
of medical information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII or
XXXIII of the CBA, the Player shall execute such individual
authorization(s) as may be requested by the Team or the Medical Director
of the Anti-Drug Program or as may be required by health care providers
who examine or treat the Player.
   8.    PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
   The Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in
accordance with the express provisions of (i) Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug
Program) of the CBA or (ii) the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic
Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse, and that any such termination
will result in the Player’s immediate dismissal and disqualification from any
employment by the NBA and any of its Teams. Notwithstanding any
terms or provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in
the event of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including
obligations to pay Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the
Team to pay the Player’s earned Compensation (whether Current or
Deferred) to the date of termination.
