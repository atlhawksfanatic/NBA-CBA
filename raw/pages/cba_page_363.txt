                                                         Article XXI    341
and participate in such Skills Competition. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no player will be required to attend and participate in such All-Star Skills
Competition for more than two (2) consecutive years, unless he is the prior
year’s winner of such All-Star Skills Competition. Any player who, at the
request of the NBA, voluntarily agrees to participate in the Slam Dunk
Competition, shall be required to attend and participate in such Slam Dunk
Competition.
    (d) Nothing in this Article XXI shall preclude a player who is an
officer or a representative of the Players Association from attending the
Players Association’s annual meeting during All-Star Weekend or preclude
any player from attending the Players Association’s All-Star party.
    (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1(a), (b) or (c)
above, a player will not be required to participate in a particular All-Star
Game, Rookie-Sophomore Game, or All-Star Skills Competition if he has
been excused from participation in the particular event by the
Commissioner because (i) he has an injury or illness that renders him
physically unable to participate in such Game or Skills Competition, or
(ii) for such other reason as the Commissioner may determine in his sole
discretion. If the player asserts that he should be excused from
participation in a particular All-Star game or event under Section 1(e)(i)
above, the Commissioner shall be authorized to require the player to
submit to a medical examination to be performed by a physician
designated by the NBA, and the determination of whether the player has
satisfied Section 1(e)(i) shall be made by such physician in his sole
discretion. In the event that a player is excused from participation in an
All-Star game or event under Section 1(e)(i) above, he shall thereafter
remain on his Team’s Inactive List until he is cleared to return to the
Active List by the NBA.
    (f) Any player who is selected to play in an All-Star Game but is
excused from participation under Section 1(e) above shall not receive the
All-Star award due to him under Section 2(a) below unless (i) he does not
play in his Team’s last Regular Season game prior to that All-Star Game or
(ii) he does not play in his Team’s first Regular Season game following that
All-Star Game.
