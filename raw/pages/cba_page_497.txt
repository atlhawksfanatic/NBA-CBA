                                               Article XLI    475
      the player’s NBADL team, the NBA and the player’s NBA
      Team may impose a fine and/or suspension on the player
      for the violation of NBADL or NBADL team rules or
      policies or for any conduct impairing the faithful and
      thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the
      player. Any disciplinary action taken by the NBA or an
      NBA Team in response to any act or conduct of a player
      during an NBADL Work Assignment or D-League Two-
      Way Service will supersede disciplinary action taken by the
      NBADL or any NBADL team in response to such act or
      conduct. Further, with respect to discipline imposed by the
      NBA and/or the NBA Team, the One Penalty rule set
      forth in Article VI, Section 10 of this Agreement shall
      apply. The amount of any such fine and/or suspension
      that may be imposed by the NBA or an NBA Team shall
      be governed by the terms of this Agreement and the
      Uniform Player Contract and shall not be limited by any
      NBADL rules, policies, practices, procedures, or fine
      schedules.
(iii) All players on NBADL Work Assignments and all Two-
      Way Players providing D-League Two-Way Service shall be
      subject to the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic
      Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse set forth as
      Exhibit F to this Agreement. Any evaluation, counseling,
      treatment, and/or discipline of such players for engaging in
      acts covered by this Policy shall be governed exclusively by
      the terms of the Policy. In the event any such player
      engages in other off-court conduct that is prohibited by
      both NBA and NBADL rules, NBA rules shall apply.
(iv)  When a player on an NBADL Work Assignment is
      suspended by his Team, the NBADL team to which he has
      been assigned, the NBA or the NBADL, such player’s Base
      Compensation for the year of the Contract during which
      such suspension occurs shall be reduced by (i) 1/145th of
      the player’s Base Compensation for each missed NBADL
      exhibition, regular season or playoff game for any
      suspension of less than twenty (20) games, and (ii) by
      1/110th of the player’s Base Compensation for each
