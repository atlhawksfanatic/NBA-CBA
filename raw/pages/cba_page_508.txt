such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and
shall be binding upon the Player.
   (b) The Player agrees: (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty,
to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii)
to be neatly and fully attired in public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off
the court according to the highest standards of honesty, citizenship, and
sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or
materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or the League.
   (c) For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of
this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough
discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may
reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance
with the terms of the CBA.
   (d) The Player agrees to be bound by Article 35 of the NBA
Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is
attached hereto. The Player acknowledges that the Commissioner is
empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes
and in the manner provided in such Article, provided that such fines
and/or suspensions are consistent with the terms of the CBA.
   (e) The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment,
shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet,
money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by
any Team or NBADL team, the Commissioner shall have the power in his
sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a player
for any Team, and the Commissionerâ€™s finding and decision shall be final,
binding, conclusive, and unappealable.
   (f) The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract,
directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice,
induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any
NBA Team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a
basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such
services, except with the prior written consent of such Team. Breach of
this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall
be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the
Commissioner.
