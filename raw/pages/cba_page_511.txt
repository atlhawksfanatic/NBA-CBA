services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist) other than a physician or

consultation or treatment to the Team and shall provide the Team with all
information it may request concerning any condition that in the judgment
of the Team’s physician may affect the Player’s ability to play skilled
basketball.
   (ii) A Player who engages in five (5) or more training or workout
