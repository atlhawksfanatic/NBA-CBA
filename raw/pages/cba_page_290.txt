268      Article VIII
                 (2) Seasons and the first Option Year shall contain no such
                 individually-negotiated additional conditions or limitations.
          (iii)  The terms and conditions (other than with respect to the
                 payment schedule for the player’s Base Compensation) that
                 apply to the second Option Year shall be unchanged from
                 all terms and conditions that applied to the player’s first
                 Option Year (including but not limited to the percentage of
                 Base Compensation that is protected), except that the
                 Salary, (excluding Incentive Compensation), Likely
                 Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses for the second Option
                 Year shall be increased over the Salary (excluding Incentive
                 Compensation), Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses,
                 respectively, for the first Option Year by the applicable
                 percentage specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale.
   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade
of a Rookie Scale Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in
such Contract, cause the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the
Salary Cap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such
Salary Cap Year, such player’s trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the
extent necessary to reduce the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for
such Salary Cap Year to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the
applicable Rookie Scale Amount.
Section 2.      Rookie Contracts for Later-Signed First Round Picks.
   Except as provided in Section 3 below, a First Round Pick who does
not sign with the Team that holds his draft rights for any portion of the
three (3) Seasons following the NBA Draft in which he was selected (and
who did not play intercollegiate basketball during such period) may enter
into either (a) a Rookie Scale Contract in accordance with Section 1 above,
or (b) if the Team has Room in excess of the applicable first-year Rookie
Scale Amount and subject to the provisions of Article VII, a Contract
covering no fewer than three (3) Seasons (not including any Option Year)
that provides for Base Compensation in the first Season greater than one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable first-year Rookie Scale
Amount.
