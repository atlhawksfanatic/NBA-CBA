266 Article VIII
            Amount for such Season shall be reduced daily through the
            end of the Regular Season by the product of the applicable
            Rookie Scale Amount (as set forth in the applicable Rookie
            Salary Scale) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
            which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the total
            number of days in such Regular Season.
     (ii)   Notwithstanding Section 1(b)(i) above, if, pursuant to any
            provision of this Agreement or the NBA Constitution and
            By-Laws, one (1) or more Teams is required to forfeit one
            (1) or more draft picks in the first round of a particular
            NBA Draft, then:
            (A)     the Rookie Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year
                    immediately following such Draft shall be adjusted
                    by removing one (1) or more Rookie Scale
                    Amounts from the middle of the Rookie Salary
                    Scale, as follows: if one (1) first round pick is
                    forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts that
                    would have been applicable to the 15th player
                    selected in the first round (absent any forfeiture of
                    picks) (hereinafter, the “15th Pick”) shall be
                    removed from the Rookie Salary Scale; if two (2)
                    first round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie
                    Scale Amounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the
                    pick immediately following the 15th Pick shall be
                    removed from the Rookie Salary Scale; if three (3)
                    first round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie
                    Scale Amounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the
                    picks immediately preceding and immediately
                    following the 15th Pick shall be removed from the
                    Rookie Salary Scale; and if more than three picks
                    are forfeited, additional Rookie Scale Amounts shall
                    be removed from the Rookie Salary Scale in
                    accordance with the foregoing procedure; and
            (B)     the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to players
                    selected in such Draft shall be determined by their
                    selection number under the Rookie Salary Scale as
                    adjusted by Section 1(b)(ii)(A) above. Accordingly,
