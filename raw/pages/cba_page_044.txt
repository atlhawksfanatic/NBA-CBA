22       Article II
No Team may (a) be a party at any one time to more than six (6) Contracts
containing an Exhibit 10, or (b) enter into a Player Contract with an
Exhibit 10 unless such Contract is for one (1) Season in length, provides

the Exhibit 10 Bonus), and does not provide for Compensation protection
of any kind pursuant to Section 3(g) above (other than in connection with

Exhibit 9 shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect
upon the exercise of such Two-Way Player Conversion Option.

skill does not result from the player’s participation in activities prohibited
