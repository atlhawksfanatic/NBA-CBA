68 Article IV
        be specified in the Pension Plan by amendment effective for
        the Plan Year beginning February 2, 2018.
        (ii) Any increase in the Normal Retirement Pension payable
        on or after the date of this Agreement: (A) shall apply only to
        those players and beneficiaries (x) who have not yet received
        or begun to receive a benefit under the Pension Plan as of the
        first day of the month following the beginning of the Plan
        Year to which the increase relates (the “New Benefit Increase
        Commencement Date”) or (y) who are receiving monthly
        benefits under the Pension Plan as of the New Benefit
        Increase Commencement Date; (B) shall be effective as of the
        New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; (C) shall apply
        only to any benefit payment(s) to be made on or after the
        applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; and
        (D) shall not require the recalculation of any benefit
        payment(s) made prior to the applicable New Benefit Increase
        Commencement Date.
        (iii) The Pension Plan shall provide that the amount of the
        Normal Retirement Pension that exceeds the Fixed Part A
        Benefit (defined below) (other than any death benefits payable
        to a beneficiary pursuant to Article VII of the Pension Plan)
        shall not be payable in the form of a Lump Sum Option. The
        “Fixed Part A Benefit” shall mean that portion of the Normal
        Retirement Pension equal to the amount described in Section
        1.21 of the Pension Plan as of the effective date of this
        Agreement; provided, however, that no adjustments for
        increases in the cost-of-living that may go into effect after the
        effective date of this Agreement shall be taken into account
        for purposes of calculating the Fixed Part A Benefit.
        (iv) The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide that a
        player shall not be considered to be on the Roster for a
        Regular Season solely because he was under a 10-Day
        Contract or Two-Way Contract as of February 2nd of such
        Regular Season.
