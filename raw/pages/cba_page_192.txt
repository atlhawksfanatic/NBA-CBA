170 Article VII
    (2) Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract
    shall be allocated over the number of Salary Cap Years (or over the
    then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years in the case of a
    signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) covered by
    such Contract in proportion to the percentage of Base
    Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of
    allocation, is protected for lack of skill; provided, however, that if
    the Player Contract provides for an Early Termination Option
    (“ETO”), the foregoing allocation shall be performed only over
    Salary Cap Years that precede the Effective Season of such ETO.
    In the event that, at the time of allocation, none of the Base
    Compensation provided for by a Player Contract (or none of the
    then-current or remaining Base Compensation in the case of a
    signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) is protected
    for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall
    be allocated to the first Salary Cap Year of the Contract (or, in the
    case of a signing bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the
    Salary Cap Year during which the player’s Contract is traded).
    (3) Extensions:
    (i)      In the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the
             Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or
             contains a signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid
             no sooner than the first day of the first Salary Cap Year
             covered by the extended term and shall be allocated, in
             equal parts, over the number of Salary Cap Years covered
             by the extended term in proportion to the percentage of
             Base Compensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at
             the time of allocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the
             event that, at the time of the allocation, none of the Base
             Compensation provided for during the extended term is
             protected for lack of skill, then the entire amount of the
             signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Salary Cap Year
             of the extended term.
    (ii)     A Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may
             enter into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing
             bonus to be paid at any time during the Contract’s original
             or extended term. In the event that a Team with a Team
