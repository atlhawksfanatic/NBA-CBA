                                                           Article IV       83
Health and Welfare Benefit Trust Agreement shall be amended, as of the
effective date of this Agreement, to change the plan name to the “NBA
Players’ Health and Welfare Benefit Plan” and to change the trust name to
the “NBA Players’ Health and Welfare Benefit Trust.” (All capitalized
terms used in this Section 3 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall
have the meanings set forth in the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan.)
   (a) Benefits. The Health and Welfare Benefit Plan shall be amended
to include the following benefits consistent with Sections 3(a)(1) through
3(a)(9) below, and the benefits described in those Sections shall be
operated and administered through the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust.
        (1) A health reimbursement arrangement (the “HRA Benefit”) for
        players who played in the NBA during and/or after the 2000-01
        Season will continue to be operated in accordance with the Health
        and Welfare Benefit Plan, which arrangement shall be administered
        and operated in compliance with IRS and U.S. Department of
        Labor rules applicable to such arrangements.
             (i) An amount to fund an HRA Benefit for each eligible
             player in respect of each Salary Cap Year that, except as may
             be limited by Section 3(e), shall equal the lesser of: (A)
             $30,000 and (B) the difference between $150,000 and the sum
             of all contributions previously made to fund an HRA Benefit
             for such player in respect of prior Salary Cap Years (including,
             for clarity, contributions made prior to the 2017-18 Salary Cap
             Year) or, if such difference is $0 or a negative number, then
             $0; provided, however, that the Health and Welfare Benefit
             Plan shall be amended to provide that amounts to fund HRA
             Benefits for each Salary Cap Year shall be provided to eligible
             players by first re-allocating from amounts forfeited under the
             Health and Welfare Benefit Plan to the Individual Accounts
             of each such eligible player or, if such amounts are insufficient
             for this purpose, then as described in Section 3(e)(1) below.
             (ii) Except as may otherwise be agreed to by the NBA and
             the Players Association, any contributions to fund the HRA
             Benefit in respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made no
             later than ninety (90) days following the completion of the
             Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.
