                                                           Article II    33
(or decrease) in the Salary Cap from the preceding Salary Cap Year to the
current Salary Cap Year. The Minimum Annual Salary Scale applicable to
a player is determined by the Salary Cap Year encompassing the first
Season covered by the player’s Contract. Accordingly, for example, if the
first Season covered by a player’s Contract is the 2018-19 Season, then the
Minimum Annual Salary Scale for the 2018-19 Salary Cap Year shall apply
for each Season of the Contract.
    (b) No 10-Day Contract or Rest-of-Season Contract (as those terms
are defined in Sections 9 and 10 below) shall provide for a Salary of less
than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player.
    (c) In determining whether a Player Contract provides for a Salary of
no less than the Minimum Player Salary applicable to that player, the
allocation of a deemed signing bonus in respect of an “international player
payment” in excess of the Excluded International Player Payment Amount
for such Salary Cap Year as set forth in Article VII, Section 3(e) (but no
other bonuses) shall be considered as part of the Salary provided for by a
Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear that the
Salary for each Season (including the allocation of any such deemed
signing bonus) equals or exceeds the Minimum Player Salary for such
Season.
    (d) On July 1, 2017, any Player Contract entered into before the
effective date of this Agreement that is not terminated on or before June
30, 2017 and provides for a Salary for the 2017-18 Season or any future
Season that is less than the applicable Minimum Player Salary for such
Season as set forth in the Minimum Annual Salary Scale for the 2017-18
Salary Cap Year (attached as Exhibit C hereto) shall be deemed amended
to provide for the applicable Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s)
under such Minimum Annual Salary Scale based upon the player’s Years of
Service for each of the applicable Seasons(s). On July 1 of each Salary Cap
Year, any Player Contract (other than a Two-Way Contract) entered into
on or after the effective date of this Agreement that provides for a Salary
for the upcoming Season that is less than the applicable Minimum Player
Salary based on the Minimum Annual Salary Scale applicable to the player
shall be deemed amended to provide for the applicable Minimum Player
Salary based on such Minimum Annual Salary Scale.
