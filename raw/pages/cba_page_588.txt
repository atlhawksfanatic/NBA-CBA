                                                          Exhibit J-1   J-1-3
Information is disclosed only to those Players Association employees,
officers, outside advisors, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in
Paragraph 2 above, Player Representatives who have a need to have access
to such Confidential Information and only for the purpose of conducting
the Audit in accordance with the terms of the CBA and this Confidentiality
Agreement; and (b) before any such person is permitted to review any
Confidential Information, he or she agrees in writing to comply with the
terms of this Confidentiality Agreement by signing the form of
acknowledgment annexed hereto as provided for in Paragraph 1 above.
The foregoing shall not foreclose the Players Association from disclosing
Confidential Information during the course of a proceeding before the
System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel of an award of the
System Arbitrator and a judicial action to enforce any such proceeding or
award.
                 4.      The Players Association agrees that no copies of
Confidential Information made available by the NBA and the Teams at
their respective offices in connection with the Audit may be removed from
such offices without the express written consent of the NBA or the Teams
(as applicable) (for example, in connection with the use of online data
rooms to permit access to information provided electronically during the
on-site audit or to respond to information requests). Should the NBA or
the Teams permit copies of Confidential Information to be removed from
their offices in connection with the Audit, then at the request of the NBA,
all such copies shall be returned to the NBA within thirty (30) days
following completion of the Audit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Players Association shall be under no obligation to return copies of the
final Audit Report or any debriefing memoranda (except to the extent such
memoranda append contract documents) prepared by the Accountants and
provided to the Players Association in connection with any audit pursuant
to Article VII, Section 10.
                 5.      If the Players Association is required by
governmental or judicial authorities (by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or any other similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, it shall provide the NBA and/or the Teams with prompt
notice so that the NBA and/or the Teams may seek an appropriate
