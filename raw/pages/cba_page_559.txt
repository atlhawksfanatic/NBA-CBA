F-4     Exhibit F
Treatment and Intervention
1. General
   The NBA or the NBPA may refer a player to the Policy Committee in
any of the following circumstances:
    a. As part of a disciplinary determination of the Commissioner for
        conduct in violation of this Policy; or
    b. After a Player is criminally convicted of an offense that involves
        conduct in violation of this Policy.
   The Policy Committee will also be available as a resource to any player
who voluntarily seeks assistance.
   Once a player has been referred to the Policy Committee, an expert
selected by the Policy Committee will conduct an initial evaluation of the
player as soon as is practicable. Following such evaluation, the Policy
Committee will develop a Treatment and Accountability Plan (“TAP”) for
the player, as may be appropriate. As part of the TAP, the Policy
Committee may require that the player submit to psychological or other
evaluations and/or attend counseling sessions with a licensed professional,
and take other steps that it deems necessary. In developing the TAP, the
Policy Committee will take into account any treatment or counseling that
the player may have initiated on his own or pursuant to a criminal
resolution of any charges against him.
   The Policy Committee will oversee the player’s compliance with any
TAP, and shall provide additional support to the player as needed. Any
treating professionals shall provide regular, written status reports to the
Policy Committee that detail the player’s progress and compliance with the
TAP. The Policy Committee may periodically revise, modify, extend, or
close the TAP on its own initiative, on the recommendation of the player’s
treating professional(s), or upon petition of the player. All information
related to a player’s involvement with the Policy Committee shall be kept
confidential.
