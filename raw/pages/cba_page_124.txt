administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams
being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian
income tax laws) when paid; and, if funded by the Teams (and not out of
existing monies remaining in the Education Trust), the costs of funding
any alternative to the Education Trust shall be applied against the New
Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, shall be limited to the
portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this
purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below, and shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations,
the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an
alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not
create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this
Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of programs provided or
to be provided by the Education Trust; (2) to lockout; or (3) to strike.
   (f) Upon written notice delivered to the NBA at least six (6) months
prior to the commencement of any Salary Cap Year, the Players
Association may elect to terminate the programs currently provided by the
Education Trust and substitute alternative programs; provided, however,
that the NBA consents to such substitution, which such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that any new programs
shall comply with the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of the Labor
Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and shall qualify as a
permitted activity of an exempt organization under Section 501(c)(5) of the
Code.
Section 6.     Additional Player Benefits
   Except as set forth below, the NBA shall provide the following
additional benefits:
   (a) Workersâ€™ compensation benefits in accordance with applicable
statutes. Such benefits will be provided for players and Two-Way Players.
   (b) Funding for the annual Players Association High School Basketball
Camp (or any substitute program mutually agreed upon by the parties) in
the amount of $1,034,012 for the 2017-18 Season, increasing by seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) per Season thereafter for the term of this
Agreement.
