450 Article XXXIII
            stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the
            event the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the
            rest of that Season) and calling for a Salary in the first
            Season covered by the Tender at least equal to the lesser of
            (A) the playerâ€™s Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which he
            was dismissed and disqualified, or (B) the Estimated
            Average Player Salary during the then-current Season, in
            either case reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season
            covered by the Tender is a partial Season, but not greater
            than the Salary provided in Section 12(g)(iii) below. If the
            previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period
            of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only
            NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a
            Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player
            Contract with the previous Team within the year following
            such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a
            Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance
            with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team
            fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an
            Unrestricted Free Agent.
     (ii)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
            12(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to
            make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player
            serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i), he is under
            contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA,
            or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional
            basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date
            on which he serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i)
            and before the date on which the previous Team makes a
            Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled
            pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain
            tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team
            that he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin
            rendering playing services for such Team immediately,
            provided that such notice will not be effective until the
            player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to
            sign with and begin rendering playing services for such
            Team.
