                                                Article VII    137
       to be included in BRI shall be allocated (with an
       appropriate interest adjustment to reflect the time value of
       money where the thing of value received by the Team or
       Related Party is in the form of cash or a cash equivalent,
       such as a check or wire transfer) over the Salary Cap Years
       in which the arena-generated BRI revenues foregone would
       have been received by the Team or Related Party (up to a
       maximum of fifteen (15) Salary Cap Years) and not on a
       lump-sum basis. With respect to transactions involving
       payments asserted to fall within the exclusion in this
       Section 1(a)(2)(xii), the NBA will provide the Players
       Association with the executed memoranda of
       understanding, term sheet, or other such executed
       summary of terms, if any, for such underlying transactions;
(xiii) Payments made to Teams or to the NBA pursuant to the
       provisions of Article VII, Section 12 (Escrow and Tax
       Arrangement) below;
(xiv)  Distributions, dividends or royalties paid by any NBA-
       related entity to owners, shareholders, members or
       partners;
(xv)   Any category or source of revenue or proceeds that was
       expressly identified in any BRI Report (as defined in
       Section 10(b) below) or in any document or written
       communication (including debriefing memos) authored by
       the Accountants and provided to the Players Association
       and the NBA (but excluding any underlying work papers)
       in connection with the Audit Reports for any of the 1995-
       96 through 2015-16 Salary Cap Years that was not included
       in BRI for such Salary Cap Years, unless such category or
       source was included on the “open issues” list prepared by
       the Accountants in connection with any of the Audit
       Reports for the 2005-06 through 2015-16 Salary Cap Years,
       in which case such category or source shall be included in
       or excluded from BRI, as the case may be, in accordance
       with the other terms of this Article;
