                a player (“Two-Way Player”) with a tiered Salary as set
                forth in Section 11(a)(ii) below based on whether the player
                is performing services on a particular day for (i) an
                NBADL team, or (ii) the NBA Team (“Two-Way
                Contract”).
         (ii)   The Salary provided for in a Two-Way Contract shall be
                the sum of the Two-Way NBA Salary (as defined in Section
                11(a)(ii)(A) below) and the Two-Way NBADL Salary (as
                defined in Section 11(a)(ii)(B) below) (together, the “Two-

                (A)      A player’s “Two-Way NBA Salary” shall equal the
                         Minimum Annual Salary called for under Article II,
                         Section 6(a) for a player with zero (0) Years of
                         Service (irrespective of how many Years of Service
                         the player has accrued prior to the Contract or
                         accrues during the term of the Contract), multiplied
                         by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                         number of NBA Days of Service (as defined in
                         Section 11(b)(i)(A) below) that the player accrues
                         during the NBA Regular Season, and the
                         denominator of which is the total number of days
                         of that NBA Regular Season.
                (B)      A player’s “Two-Way NBADL Salary” shall equal
                         the player’s Two-Way Annual NBADL Salary
                         called for below, multiplied by a fraction, the
                         numerator of which is the number of NBADL
                         Days of Service (as defined in Section 11(b)(i)(B)
                         below) that the player accrues during the NBADL
