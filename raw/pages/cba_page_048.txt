    (e) Mental Disability. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or
in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract
in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to
paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player’s failure to render his
services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player’s mental
disability, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or
