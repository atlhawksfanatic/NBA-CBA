                     Year by more than eight percent (8%) of BRI for
                     the Salary Cap Year or if the amount of the
                     Overage described above exceeds nine percent
                     (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then divide
                     the result of Step 1 by the number of Teams in
                     the NBA during the subsequent Salary Cap Year
                     (other than Expansion Teams in their first two
                     (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of
                     this calculation is the amount of the reduction in
                     the Tax Level for such subsequent Salary Cap
                     Year, and no further steps are required.
            If Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap Year
            exceeds BRI for the Salary Cap Year by more than eight
            percent (8%) of BRI for the Salary Cap Year and the
            amount of the Overage described above does not exceed
            nine percent (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then
            proceed to Step 3.
            STEP 3: Subtract BRI for the Salary Cap Year from
                     Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap
                     Year.
            STEP 4: Subtract eight percent (8%) of BRI for the Salary
                     Cap Year from the result of Step 3.
            STEP 5: Multiply the result of Step 4 by fifty-three and
                     fifty-one one hundredths percent (53.51%).
            STEP 6: Subtract the result of Step 5 from the result of
                     Step 1. If the result of this step is less than zero,
                     then no adjustments shall be made to the Tax
                     Level for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, and no
                     further steps are required.
            STEP 7: Divide the result of Step 6 by the number of
                     Teams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary
                     Cap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their
                     first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The
                     result of this calculation is the amount of the
