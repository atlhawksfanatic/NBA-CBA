100      Article IV
the Players Association agree to meet and confer to discuss the Education
Trust establishing a modified financial education program, subject to the
modified financial education program being structured to qualify as a
permitted activity of an exempt organization under the provisions of
Section 501(c)(5) of the Code; provided, however, that neither party shall
have any obligation to establish a modified financial education program.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that an agreed-upon
modified financial education program cannot be structured to qualify as a
permitted activity of an exempt organization under the provisions of
Section 501(c)(5) of the Code, the NBA and Players Association agree to
meet and confer regarding the establishment of such program through a
different vehicle than the Education Trust. The specific benefits to be
provided under any financial education program shall be (A) subject to the
agreement of the NBA and the Players Association and (B) governed by a
definitive written arrangement implementing such program.
   (c) (1) Except as provided in Section 5(c)(2) below, the costs of
         funding the Education Trust and the costs attributable to the
         operation and administration of the Education Trust, including,
         without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees incurred in
         connection with the administration of the Education Trust, shall
         be (i) paid by the Teams; (ii) applied against the New Benefit
         Amount provided for by Section 8 below; and (iii) limited to the
         portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for
         this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below. Payment of the
         amount necessary to fund the Education Trust in respect of each
         Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30) days following the
         completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year. The
         NBA and Players Association agree that, subject to the limitations
         set forth in this Section 5, the amount to be paid by the Teams to
         fund the education and career counseling programs to be operated
         and administered by the Education Trust for the 2017-18 Salary
         Cap Year shall be no greater than $1,507,608 and such maximum
         funding amount shall be increased by five percent (5%) for each
         subsequent Salary Cap Year.
         (2) The costs of funding the health education programs to be
         operated and administered by the Education Trust (or any
         programs that, pursuant to Section 5(f) below, are substituted for
         the health education programs) shall be paid by the Teams.
