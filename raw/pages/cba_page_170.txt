148 Article VII
                     determined in accordance with the foregoing and
                     will instead be determined by the applicable
                     provisions of Section 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.
    (8) In the event that, pursuant to the NBAâ€™s national broadcast,
    national telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA
    Teams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to
    NBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such
    proceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap
    Years (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap
    Year in which such proceeds are actually received) as the number
    of Salary Cap Years in which such games were televised. Any
    other contingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such
    agreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manner
    agreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a
    reasonable manner determined by the Accountants.
    (9) The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use
    their commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each
    Salary Cap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the exercise
    of such commercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and each NBA
    Team shall be entitled to act in a manner consistent with their
    reasonable business judgment and shall not (i) take any action
    intended to benefit, at the expense of BRI, other commercial
    activities (such as the WNBA and the NBADL) unrelated to the
    performance of Players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-
    related activities, or (ii) shift or forgo revenues attributable to
    Salary Cap Years during the term of this Agreement in exchange
    for revenues or benefits during Salary Cap Years following the
    expiration of this Agreement (unless there is a reasonable business
    justification unrelated to collective bargaining for such shift or
    forgoing). There shall be no obligation on the part of the NBA or
    any NBA Team to accelerate into Salary Cap Years within the term
    of this Agreement revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years
    following the expiration of this Agreement. In evaluating
    compliance with this subsection, the parties and the System
    Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial weight to the
    reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA Team but
    no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to have
    shifted or forgone revenues of $350 million or more for the
