F-6     Exhibit F
hotline, experts, and counselors, will be shared equally by the Parties
(unless otherwise covered by the NBA Players Group Health Plan or other
insurance plan provided to NBA players). The NBPA’s share shall be paid
by the NBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6 of
the CBA. The NBA’s share will be excluded from the calculation of
Benefits under the CBA.
Investigation of Incidents
   The NBA will give the NBPA and the player prompt notice of the
commencement of any investigation into an alleged violation of this Policy.
   The NBA’s investigation may include the use of third party resources
including, but not limited to, outside legal counsel, outside investigators, or
other individuals with relevant experience or expertise.
   The NBA will notify the NBPA when it has concluded its investigation
and report whether it believes a violation of the Policy has occurred.
Cooperation
   Except in circumstances where the player has a reasonable
apprehension of criminal prosecution, players shall cooperate fully with
any NBA investigation under this Policy. Any player interviewed by the
NBA as part of its investigation is entitled to have a representative from
the NBPA present during the interview, and the NBA will provide the
NBPA with at least 48 hours’ notice before any in-person interview.
   Failing to cooperate in full, or interfering in any manner, with an NBA
investigation will subject the non-cooperative individual to discipline
consistent with the terms of Article VI, Section 11(a) of the CBA. It may
constitute a violation of this cooperation requirement for a player to
attempt to or enter into any agreement with a witness, victim, or other
party that would discourage or prevent that individual from cooperating
with an NBA investigation. However, the player is under no obligation to
demand, request or otherwise encourage anyone to cooperate with an
NBA investigation.
