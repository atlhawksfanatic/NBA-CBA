                                                              Article VII    247
                         reduction in the Tax Level for such subsequent
                         Salary Cap Year.
    Example: Assume Total Salaries and Benefits for the 2019-20 Season are
    $4.686 billion and the Designated Share is $4.335 billion resulting in an
    Overage of $351 million (which equals 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits).
    Assume Projected BRI for the 2020-21 Season ($8.925 billion) exceeds
    actual BRI for the 2019-20 Season ($8.500 billion) by 5%. Assume there
    are 30 Teams in the NBA in 2020-21. The Tax Level for the 2020-21
    Season would be reduced by $2.3 million ((7.5% of Total Salaries and
    Benefits ($351 million) less 6% of Total Salaries and Benefits ($281
    million)) divided by 30).
    Example: Same Total Salaries and Benefits as in the prior example, except
    assume Projected BRI for the 2020-21 Season ($9.265 billion) exceeds actual
    BRI for the 2019-20 Season ($8.500 billion) by 9%. The Tax Level for the
    2020-21 Season would be reduced by $0.8 million ($25 million (the Overage
    of 7.5% of Total Salaries and Benefits ($351 million) less 6% of Total
    Salaries and Benefits ($281 million)), less $45 million (i.e., the difference
    between (x) Projected BRI for the 2020-21 Season ($9.265 billion) less
    actual BRI for the 2019-20 Season ($8.500 billion) (i.e., $765 million) and
    (y) 8% of actual BRI for the 2019-20 Season (i.e., $680 million) -- a
    difference of $85 million -- multiplied by 53.51%), divided by 30).
    (18) “Trade Bonus Deduction Date” means, with respect to an
    Adjustment Player, the earlier of (i) the date that any trade bonus
    earned by the player during the applicable Salary Cap Year is paid
    to the player pursuant to his Contract, or (ii) the June 30 of such
    Salary Cap Year.
(b) Compensation Adjustment Rules.
    (1) In the event that there is an Overage in any Salary Cap Year,
    (i) the Contracts of all Adjustment Players shall be amended by
    operation of this Agreement, such that the aggregate
    Compensation otherwise payable to all such Adjustment Players
    with respect to such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by the
    Aggregate Compensation Adjustment Amount, (ii) the New
    Benefit Amount for such Season as provided for by Article IV,
    Section 8(a)(1) (i.e., the New Benefit amount that is presently
