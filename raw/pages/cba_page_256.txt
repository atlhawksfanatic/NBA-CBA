234     Article VII
review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In connection
with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap Year, each
Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants, the NBA
and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries and Benefits
information for such Salary Cap Year, on forms agreed upon by the NBA,
the Players Association and the Accountants (the “BRI Reports”). The
NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon such forms no later
than April 1 of each Salary Cap Year.
   (c) The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates
of revenues or expenses for a Salary Cap Year included in the Teams’ and
the NBA’s BRI Reports for such Salary Cap Year and may make such
adjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the
actual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap
Year differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the
following Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of Section
10(f) below.
   (d) With respect to deducted expenses, except for Newly-Deductible
International Expenses, the NBA, League-related entities, Teams and
Related Parties shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are
reasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of Section
1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) and Section 1(a)(14)
above, and Section 11 below, all categories of expenses deducted in a BRI
Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be reviewed by the
Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be reasonable and
customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by the NBA or a
Team that come within such expense categories shall also be presumed to
be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or amounts are found
by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the revenues involved or
grossly excessive.
   (e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the
NBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any
questions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by the
Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI
Reports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made
to any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the
BRI Reports.
