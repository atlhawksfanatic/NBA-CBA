384     Article XXIX
Section 5.     Minimum League-Wide Roster.
   Beginning with the 2017-18 Season, if for two consecutive Regular
Seasons (e.g., 2017-18 and 2018-19 or 2018-19 and 2019-20, but not 2017-
18 and 2019-20), NBA Teams in the aggregate employ an average of less
than fourteen and one-half (14.5) players (excluding Two-Way Players) per
Team, then for each Regular Season covered by this Agreement that
follows such consecutive two-year period, the minimum Inactive List
requirements set forth in the first two sentences of Section 2 above shall
be increased by one (1) (“League-Wide Roster Increase”), so that Teams
would for the remaining Seasons of the term of this Agreement be
required to employ fifteen (15) players per team (excluding Two-Way
Players) except as permitted in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 above.
        The foregoing rule shall be measured following each Regular
        Season as follows:
        STEP 1: For each player signed to a Player Contract (including a
                  Rest-of-Season or 10-Day Contract, but excluding a
                  Two-Way Contract) during a Regular Season, determine
                  the number of days during such Regular Season that such
                  player was carried on his Team’s Active List or Inactive
                  List (hereinafter “Duty Days”).
        STEP 2: Determine the total Duty Days for all players for such
                  Regular Season by adding together the results for each
                  player from Step 1.
        STEP 3: Multiply (x) the number of NBA Teams that played
                  games during the applicable Regular Season, by (y) 2,480
                  days.
        STEP 4: If, for two consecutive Regular Seasons beginning with
                  the 2017-18 Season, the result in Step 2 above is less than
                  the result in Step 3 above, then the League-Wide Roster
                  Increase will be triggered.
Section 6.     Playing Rules and Officiating.
   (a) Up to four (4) representatives of the Players Association, three (3)
of whom shall be active or recently retired players selected by the Players
