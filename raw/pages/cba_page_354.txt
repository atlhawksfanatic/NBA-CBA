332      Article XIX
with the player and his Team. If there is no resolution of the matter within
seven (7) days, then the Team will, upon the written request of the Players
Association, suspend the player without pay, wherever legal. Such
suspension will continue until the Players Association has notified the
Team in writing that the suspended player has satisfied his obligation as
contained in Section 1 above. The parties hereby agree that suspension
without pay is adopted as a substitute for and in lieu of discharge as the
penalty for a violation of the union security clause of this Agreement and
that no player will be discharged for a violation of that clause.
    A copy of all notices required by this Section 3(a) will be simultaneously
mailed to the player involved and the NBA.
    (b) The term “member in good standing” as used in this Article XIX
applies only to the payment of dues or any initiation fee and not to any
other factors involved in union discipline.
    (c) Other than pursuant to Section 2 above, no Team shall pay any
initiation fees, dues, or financial core fees on behalf of any player.
Section 4.     No Liability.
    Neither the NBA nor any Team shall be liable for any salary, bonus, or
other monetary or non-monetary claims that result from a player being
suspended pursuant to the terms of Section 3 above. The Players
Association indemnifies, saves and holds harmless the NBA and each
Team against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability
that may arise, directly or indirectly, in connection with the enforcement or
application of any term or provision of this Article XIX, including, without
limitation, claims relating to any action taken by the NBA or any Team in
reliance upon any written authorization provided hereunder.
