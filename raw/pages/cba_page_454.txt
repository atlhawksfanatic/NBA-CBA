and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities
were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players
Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the
Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of
their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution
of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of
sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse
to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In
conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be
identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an
Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth
in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.
    (c) Immediately upon the Independent Expert’s issuance of an
Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall
arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the
Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use,

authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s

Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s
use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times

or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section
5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association
with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED
pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the
applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may
be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable
consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the
Authorization for Testing was issued.
    (e) In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association
determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the
