48      Article II
  Aggregate Number of Players on Team’s          Maximum Number of
  Active List and Inactive List (including       the Team’s players who
  players signed to 10-Day Contracts, but        can be signed to 10-
  not including Two-Way Players)                 Day Contracts
                       12                                   0
                       13                                   1
                       14                                   2
                       15                                   3
For example, if a Team has thirteen (13) players on its Active List (not
including any Two-Way Players) and no players on its Inactive List, then
the Team may have one player under a 10-Day Contract. If a Team has
thirteen (13) players on its Active List (including one (1) Two-Way Player)
and two (2) players on its Inactive List (not including any Two-Way
Players), then the Team may have two (2) players under a 10-Day
Contract. If a Team has twelve (12) players on its Active List (not
including any Two-Way Players) and three (3) players on its Inactive List
(not including any Two-Way Players), then the Team may have three (3)
players under a 10-Day Contract.
   (d) No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract if the length of such
Contract, in accordance with Section 9(a), would extend to or past the date
of the Team’s last Regular Season game for such Season.
   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in a Uniform
Player Contract, a 10-Day Contract shall be terminated simply by
providing written notice to the player (and not by following the waiver
procedure set forth in paragraph 16 of the Uniform Player Contract) and
paying only such sums as are set forth in Exhibit 1A (or, if applicable,
Exhibit 1) of such Contract.
Section 10. Rest-of-Season Contracts.
   (a) At any time after the first day of an NBA Regular Season, a Team
may enter into a Player Contract that may provide Compensation to a
player only for the remainder of that Season (a “Rest-of-Season
Contract”).
   (b) The Salary provided for in a Rest-of-Season Contract shall not be
less than the Minimum Player Salary.
