                                                        Article XXXI      409
   (g) A Team shall not be required to terminate a Player Contract under
the NBA waiver procedure as a condition precedent to the filing of a
Grievance with respect to such Player Contract. To the extent that the
decision of the Impartial Arbitrator in In re: Otis Birdsong, Dec. No. 87-2,
May 14, 1987, is inconsistent with the foregoing, it is hereby overruled.
   (h) In a proceeding involving the interpretation of a Player Contract,
no Uniform Player Contract (whether signed during the term of this
Agreement or during the term of any prior collective bargaining agreement
between the parties), or amendment thereto, other than the Player
Contract or amendment that is the subject of dispute shall be admissible as
evidence of the meaning of, or of the partiesâ€™ intentions with respect to,
any individually-negotiated terms or provisions in the Player Contract or
amendment that is the subject of dispute.
