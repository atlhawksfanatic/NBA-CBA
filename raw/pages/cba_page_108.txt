86 Article IV
   (4) All of the benefits provided for in Section 3(a)(2) are subject
   to their permissibility and availability under applicable law.
   (5) The Board of Trustees of the Health and Welfare Benefit
   Trust (the “Health and Welfare Trustees”) may make changes to
   any of the insurance programs provided under Section 3(a)(2),
   provided that any such change that would result in an increase in
   the costs or a change in the types or levels of any of the benefits,
   or that would change any such program from an insured program
   to a self-insured program or vice versa, must be mutually agreed to
   in writing by the NBA and the Players Association.
   (6) Subject to Section 3(a)(6)(i)-(ii) below, the NBA and the
   Players Association shall provide retiree health insurance benefits
   which, as of the effective date of this Agreement, are being
   provided through UnitedHealthcare Policy Numbers 908971,
   16160, 16161 and 16162 (collectively, the “Retiree Medical Plan”).
        (i) The Retiree Medical Plan will be established only for the
        term of this Agreement; provided, however, that the NBA and
        the Players Association (or, if so delegated by the NBA and
        the Players Association in writing, the Health and Welfare
        Trustees) reserve the right, by mutual written agreement, to
        modify, amend or terminate, in whole or in part, the Retiree
        Medical Plan with respect to any or all eligible retirees and
        their eligible dependents at any time or for any reason, and no
        eligible retirees or eligible dependents (or other NBA players,
        retired NBA players or their dependents) shall under any
        circumstances have any vested rights of any nature with
        respect to the Retiree Medical Plan or any retiree health
        benefit (whether or not the player or retired player, or their
        dependents, has participated in the Retiree Medical Plan).
        (ii) The NBA and the Players Association (or, if so
        delegated by the NBA and the Players Association in writing,
        the Health and Welfare Trustees) reserve the right, by mutual
        written agreement, to increase or otherwise change the
        amount of monthly premiums under the Retiree Medical Plan
        charged to players at any time and for any reason.
