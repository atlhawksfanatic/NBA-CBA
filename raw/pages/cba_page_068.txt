   (b) Upon request by the Team, the NBA, or a League-related entity,
and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below, the Player
shall wear a wireless microphone during any game or practice, including
warm-up periods and going to and from the locker room to the playing

publicity or promotional purposes.
         (i)    The NBA or a League-related entity will be responsible for
                providing the audio equipment and for the placement of

                the prior consent of the player.

                or detrimental to the player or other players.
         (iv)   All audio tapes containing approved Player Audio will be
                returned by the telecaster to the NBA and archived.

                would be prejudicial or detrimental to him if replayed in
                any non-game programming (e.g., home videos) or other
                publicity or promotional content, and notifies the NBA to
                that effect in writing within one hundred twenty (120)
                hours of the recording of such audio, then neither the
