    amount”), the maximum loan amount for that Season shall be
    reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual allocable
    repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining Current Base
    Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill. (For
    example, if a Player has $2 million in Current Base Compensation
    (fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of a five-year
    Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time when the
    Player has already received his Current Base Compensation for that
    Season, the loan may not exceed $1.6 million.)
    (3) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2)
    above: (i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of
    Article II, Section 13(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player
    whose Contract provides for Base Compensation equal to the
    Minimum Player Salary.
    (4) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be
    deemed a Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness
    and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth
    in Section 7 below.
(d) Incentive Compensation.

    below), shall be included in Salary only if such Performance Bonus
    would be earned if the Team’s or player’s performance were
    identical to the performance in the immediately preceding Salary
    Cap Year.
    (2) Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at
    the time of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension,
    the NBA or the Players Association believes that the performance
    of a player and/or his Team during the immediately preceding
    Salary Cap Year does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player
    earning a Performance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered
    by the Contract, Renegotiation or extended term of the Extension
