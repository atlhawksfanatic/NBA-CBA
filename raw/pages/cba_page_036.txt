14        Article I
   (iiii)     “Years of Service” means the number of years of NBA service
credited to a player in accordance with the following: a player will be
credited with one (1) year of NBA service for each year that he is on an
NBA Active List or Inactive List for one (1) or more days during the
Regular Season. Notwithstanding the above, a player will not receive
credit for a Year of Service for any year in which he: (i) withholds playing
services called for by a Player Contract or this Agreement for more than
thirty (30) days after the Season begins, or (ii) is a Restricted Free Agent,
has been tendered a Qualifying Offer by his Prior Team and the Prior
Team has extended the date by which the player may accept the Qualifying
Offer until March 1 in accordance with the Article XI, Section 4(c)(i), and
has not signed a Player Contract with any Team by March 1. In addition,
notwithstanding the above, a player will not receive credit for a Year of
Service for being on an NBA Active List or Inactive List as a result of
signing a Player Contract that is disapproved by the Commissioner. In no
event can a player be credited with more than one (1) Year of Service with
respect to any one NBA Season. A Year of Service will be credited to a
player on the June 30 following the Season with respect to which it is
being credited. Under no circumstances shall the definition of Years of
Service herein be used for purposes of determining a player’s years of
credited eligibility, benefit, and/or vesting service under any benefit plan
or program provided for under Article IV of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the Pension Plan, 401(k) Plan, Health and Welfare
Benefit Plan (including the Retiree Medical Plan, HRA Benefit, and tuition
reimbursement program), or Post-Career Income Plan. Players shall be
credited with Years of Service pursuant to this Section 1(iiii) only in
respect of Seasons covered by this Agreement. Years of Service credit for
Seasons prior to the 2005 NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the 1999
NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement.
