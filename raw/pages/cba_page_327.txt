                                                          Article XII   305
(including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base Compensation that is
protected). If a Player Contract contains an Option in favor of the player
and provides, in whole or in part, for Base Compensation protection in the
Option Year, such Contract must also contain, in Exhibit 2 of the Contract
under the heading “Additional Conditions or Limitations,” either the
language set forth in subsection (A) below or the language set forth in
subsection (B) below, but not both, and such language shall define the
respective rights and obligations of the player and Team with respect to
the subject matter thereof:
                (A)     “If this Contract is terminated by Team prior to
                        Player’s exercise of the Option described in Exhibit
                        1 of the Contract, then Player shall be entitled to
                        benefit from the Base Compensation protection
                        provisions of this Exhibit 2 to the same extent as if
                        the exercise of the Option by Player had occurred
                        prior to Team’s termination of the Contract.”
                (B)     “If this Contract is terminated by Team prior to
                        Player’s exercise of the Option described in Exhibit
                        1 of the Contract, then Team shall be relieved of
                        any obligation to pay Player any Base
                        Compensation with respect to the Option Year.”
No Player Contract that contains the language set forth in subsection (B)
above may provide for the Option in favor of the player to be exercisable
earlier than the day following the date of the Team’s last game of the
Season prior to the Option Year; and/or
    (b) an Early Termination Option (or “ETO”) (as defined in Article I,
Section 1(v)), provided that such ETO is exercisable only once and takes
effect no earlier than the end of the fourth Season of the Contract. A
Contract that does not provide for an ETO when signed may not be
amended to provide for an ETO during the original term of the Contract.
If a Team and a player enter into an Extension (other than an Extension of
a Rookie Scale Contract), the Contract may not be amended to provide for
an ETO and any previously-existing ETO must be eliminated. If a Team
and player enter into an Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract, the
Contract may simultaneously be amended to provide for an ETO,
