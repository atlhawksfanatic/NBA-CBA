                                                              Article XI  299
          (ii)   Decline to continue to possess such rights with respect to
                 the player as the ROFR Team possessed at the time of the
                 execution of the Offer Sheet, in which case any Qualifying
                 Offer given to the player by the Team shall be deemed
                 withdrawn pursuant to Section 4(c)(i) above, and the
                 Team’s Right of First Refusal shall be deemed relinquished
                 pursuant to Section 5(o) below.
If at the time the New Team notifies the ROFR Team that the player has
not passed the physical administered by the New Team, the ROFR Team
has not yet exercised its Right of First Refusal or has not yet provided
written notice to the player that the ROFR Team declines to exercise its
Right of First Refusal, nothing in this Section 5(l) shall prohibit a ROFR
Team from: (i) exercising its Right of First Refusal; or (ii) making one of
the elections set forth in Section 5(l)(i) or 5(l)(ii) above.

pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e).
    (n) There may be only one (1) Offer Sheet signed by a Restricted Free
Agent outstanding at any one time, provided that the Offer Sheet has also
been signed by a Team. An Offer Sheet, both before and after it is given
to the ROFR Team, may be revoked or withdrawn only upon the written
consent of the ROFR Team, the New Team, and the Restricted Free
Agent. In such event, a Restricted Free Agent shall again be free to
negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with any Team, and any Team shall again
be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with such Restricted Free
Agent, subject only to the ROFR Team’s renewed Right of First Refusal.
    (o) A Team that holds the Right of First Refusal with respect to a
Restricted Free Agent may relinquish such Right of First Refusal at any

Qualifying Offer. If a Team relinquishes its Right of First Refusal with
respect to a Restricted Free Agent, the player shall immediately become an
Unrestricted Free Agent and the Team shall be deemed to have renounced
the player in accordance with Article VII, Section 4(g) hereof. In order to
