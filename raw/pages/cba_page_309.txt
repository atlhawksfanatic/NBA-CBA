                                                              Article XI    287
                  selected in the first round of the Draft (the “twenty-first
                  player”) as called for by the Rookie Salary Scale applicable
                  to Rookie Scale Contracts finishing in the same Season as
                  the last Season of the player’s Contract. For purposes of
                  calculating such Qualifying Offer amount, the Fourth Year
                  Salary of the twenty-first player shall be deemed to equal
                  one hundred percent (100%) of the Rookie Scale Amount
                  applicable to the twenty-first player.
           (v)    All other terms and conditions in a Qualifying Offer must
                  be unchanged from those that applied to the last year of
                  the player’s prior Contract to the extent that such terms
                  and conditions are allowable amendments under this
                  Agreement at the time the Qualifying Offer is made. In
                  addition, a Team shall be permitted to include in any
                  Qualifying Offer an Exhibit 6 to the Uniform Player
                  Contract requiring that the player, if he signs the Qualifying
                  Offer, pass a physical examination to be performed by a
                  physician designated by the Team as a condition precedent
                  to the validity of the Contract. For purposes of the
                  foregoing, the Starter Criteria shall be determined based
                  upon Official NBA statistics.
    (d) No Team or any of its employees or agents will make a public
statement that the Team would match any future Offer Sheet for one of
the Team’s players or offer an impending or current Restricted Free Agent
a particular Player Contract in free agency (e.g., a Contract providing for
the player’s maximum allowable Salary). The foregoing does not limit a
Team’s ability to express its desire to retain an impending or current
Restricted Free Agent or to make general statements praising such a player
(e.g., that the player is an important or essential part of the Team, that the
Team wants or hopes to retain the player’s services, and other similar
statements).
Section 2.      No Individually-Negotiated Right of First Refusal
    (a) No Player Contract may include any individually-negotiated Right
of First Refusal or other limitation on player movement following the last
Salary Cap Year covered by such Player Contract.
