164   Article VII
  (d) Adjustments to Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary.
      (1) In the event that Total Salaries and Benefits for any Salary
      Cap Year are less than the Designated Share (as defined in Section
      12(b)(3) below) for such Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for
      the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be increased by the amount
      of the shortfall divided by the number of Teams in the NBA
      during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion
      Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA).
      (2) In the event that there is an Overage (as defined in Section
      12(a)(14) below) in any Salary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap for
      the subsequent Salary Cap Year shall be adjusted as follows:
      (i)     If the amount of the Overage in the Salary Cap Year is
              equal to or less than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and
              Benefits, then no adjustments shall be made to the Salary
              Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year.
      (ii)    If the amount of the Overage in the Salary Cap Year equals
              more than six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and Benefits,
              then the Salary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year
              shall be reduced by an amount to be calculated as follows:
              STEP 1: Subtract six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and
                         Benefits from the Overage.
              STEP 2: If Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap
                         Year does not exceed BRI for the Salary Cap
                         Year by more than eight percent (8%) of BRI for
                         the Salary Cap Year or the amount of the
                         Overage described above exceeds nine percent
                         (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then divide
                         the result of Step 1 by the number of Teams in
                         the NBA during the subsequent Salary Cap Year
                         (other than Expansion Teams in their first two
                         (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The result of
                         this calculation is the amount of the reduction in
                         the Salary Cap for such subsequent Salary Cap
                         Year, and no further steps are required.
