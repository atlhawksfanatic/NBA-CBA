           the player’s Salary (in the first Season of the extended term)
           will equal “[_____]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the
           first Season of the extended term.” The percentage to be
           included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing
           language shall equal the percentage that is agreed upon by
           the Team and player, which shall in no event be less than
           twenty-five percent (25%) or greater than thirty percent
           (30%); or
    (ii)   in the case of a Rookie Scale Extension for any other First
           Round Pick (i.e., a First Round Pick who at the time the
           Extension is executed had not yet met at least one of the
           5th Year 30% Max Criteria), the player and Team may
           instead provide in the Extension that the player’s Salary (in
           the first Season of the extended term) will equal “25% of
           the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of the
           extended term, or, if the player meets at least one of the
           applicable 5th Year 30% Max Criteria during the fourth
           Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, [ ]% of the Salary
           Cap in effect during the first Season of the extended term.”
           The percentage to be included where brackets are indicated
           in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage of the
           Salary Cap that is agreed upon by the Team and player,
           which shall in no event be less than twenty-five percent
           (25%) or greater than thirty percent (30%).
    (iii)  As an alternative to (i) or (ii) above, the Team may instead
           provide in the Extension that the player’s Salary (in the first
           Season of the extended term) will equal alternative
           percentages of the Salary Cap (which shall in no event be
           less than twenty-five percent (25%) or greater than thirty
           percent (30%)) based upon how and whether the player
           satisfies the applicable 5th Year 30% Max Criteria.

           Extension entered into on or after the effective date of this
           Agreement in which the first Season of the extended term
           commences with the 2019-20 Season, the Team and player
