I-3-2   Exhibit I-3
   The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form
(which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the
handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities
concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both the player
and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed
and sent via an overnight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a
hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit
containing the two specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to
the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be
sent to the laboratory electronically.
   Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be
placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different
laboratory, if requested by the player.
