Players Association will, upon request, consent to the earlier

practice on the Holiday, as communicated to the Team by the Team’s
player representative; and (ii) within seven (7) days before or after the
Holiday, the Team’s players are provided with a “day off” — i.e., the Team
will not conduct any practice, including any optional practice, on such date,
and the Team will not have a scheduled game on such date.
   (d) Teams shall not depart for an away game or series of away games

unusual circumstances and unless the Players Association consents thereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
