Grievance is initiated by the Players Association, the thirty-day time period
referred to in Section 2(c) above shall commence with the date upon which
the Player Contract (or amendment thereto) containing the disputed term
or provision was first made available for inspection by the Players
Association.
    (b) If, as a result of the Grievance and Arbitration procedure, a Player
Contract is found to contain a term or provision that is not permitted by
this Agreement, then (i) such term or provision shall be deleted from the
Player Contract and have no force or effect, and the Player Contract shall
in all other respects remain valid and binding upon the parties thereto, and
(ii) if the Team and the player agree to reform or revise the Player Contract
within thirty (30) days of the Grievance Arbitrator’s decision, such
reformation or revision shall be exempted from the rules governing
Renegotiations contained in Article VII, Section 7(c).
    (c) Nothing set forth above shall affect in any manner the
Commissioner’s authority with respect to the approval or disapproval of
Player Contracts pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Uniform Player Contract;
and the fact that the Commissioner has approved or not disapproved a
Player Contract containing a term or provision not permitted by this
Agreement shall not be referred to in the course of the Grievance and
Arbitration procedure and shall not be considered in any manner or for
any purpose by the Grievance Arbitrator in connection with a dispute
concerning that Player Contract.
Section 12. Disputes with Respect to Players Under Contract Who
                Withhold Playing Services.
    In addition to any other rights a Team may have under contract or law,
including those under paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, a Team
may recover damages in a proceeding before the Grievance Arbitrator
when a player who is party to a currently effective Player Contract fails or
refuses to render the services called for under the Player Contract. In any
such proceeding, where the Grievance Arbitrator determines that damages
are continuing to accrue at the time of the hearing, the Arbitrator shall
award such damages (if any) as the Team has by then sustained, and the
hearing shall remain open to enable the submission of proof on the issue
of continuing damages.
