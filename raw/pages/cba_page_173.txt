                                               Article VII     151
            BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which
            the exercise or conversion occurs (if the resulting
            securities were Publicly Tradable at that time) or in
            the Salary Cap Year in which the resulting securities
            later become Publicly Tradable, whichever is first;
     (C)    if the equity securities (including contingent
            securities and any securities resulting from the
            exercise or conversion of contingent securities) are
            not Publicly Tradable at the time of receipt (or, in
            the case of contingent securities, at the time of
            exercise or conversion), no BRI value shall be
            attributable to such securities until they become
            Publicly Tradable or are sold or otherwise
            transferred for consideration other than securities
            that are not Publicly Tradable, whichever is first, at
            which time the Publicly Traded Value or Net
            Proceeds, as applicable, will be included in BRI
            commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which such
            event occurs; or
     (D)    notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contingent
            securities are exercisable or convertible into
            securities that are or become Publicly Tradable, but
            those contingent securities are not exercised or
            converted within one (1) year of any such right, the
            Players Association shall have the right, by written
            notice to the NBA, to have the Publicly Traded
            Value of such securities included in BRI as if those
            contingent securities had been exercised or
            converted on the date of such notice (net of any
            exercise or conversion price and taxes, as
            determined below).
(ii) For purposes of this Section 1(a)(13), (A) “Publicly
