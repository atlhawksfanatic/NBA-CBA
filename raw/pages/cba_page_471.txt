                                                 Article XXXIII    449
     (iii) A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this
           Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his
           previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely
           Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player’s Salary
           and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year
           in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a
           pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a
           partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or
           above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the
           Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the
           player and the previous Team enter into such Player
           Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season,
           increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the
           first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section
           5(c)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is
           reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term
           of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of
           Seasons in the player’s new Contract may not exceed two
           (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the
           Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in
           any Season of the player’s new Contract, including any
           Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely
           Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his
           Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract
           contains terms identical to those contained in the
           remaining Seasons of the Player’s Rookie Scale Contract at
           the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team
           exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new
           Contract, then the player’s Team shall retain the same
           rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have
           retained under Article XI following the completion of the
           player’s Rookie Scale Contract.
(g) (i)    A Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this
           Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,
           notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time
           of his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”).
           Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section
           12(g)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty
           (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a
