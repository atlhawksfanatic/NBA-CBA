                                                           Article II     27
be construed as requiring) such Team to continue to employ the player
(whether on the Active List, Inactive List, Two-Way List or otherwise); nor
shall any such agreement afford the player any right to be employed, or to
be deemed as having been employed, by such Team for any purpose.
   (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for by a Uniform Player Contract, and such protection is
contingent on the satisfaction of a condition expressly set forth in Exhibit
2 to that Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if
the Player Contract has not previously been terminated at the time such
condition is satisfied.
   (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for in any Option Year in favor of the Team included in a
Uniform Player Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective
only if the option to extend the term provided for in the Contract was
exercised by the Team prior to the termination of the Contract. When a
Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation
provided for in any Option Year in favor of the player, the applicability of
such protection in the circumstance where the Option has not been
exercised by the player shall be governed by the provisions of Article XII,
Section 2(a).
   (i) During the term of a Player Contract, the percentage of protected
Base Compensation for any future Season shall not exceed the percentage
of unearned protected Base Compensation for any prior Season. Thus, for
example, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50%) Base
Compensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one
hundred percent (100%) Base Compensation protection in the second
Season of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a
Team from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a
future Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of
Base Compensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition
cannot be satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example,
it is permissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation
protection for the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent
(50%) and Base Compensation protection for the second Season will be
increased from fifty percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) if the
