game); provided, however, that the foregoing sentence shall not
apply in the event a player is determined to have suffered a career-
ending injury or illness pursuant to Section 4((h)(2)(ii) above. After
a player’s Salary for one (1) or more Salary Cap Years has been
included in Team Salary in accordance with this Section 4(h)(3), the
Team shall be permitted to re-apply to have the player’s Salary (for
each Salary Cap Year remaining at the time of the re-application)
excluded from Team Salary in accordance with the rules set forth
in this Section 4(h) (including the waiting period criteria set forth in
Section 4(h)(1) above).
(4) If a Team applies to have a player’s Salary excluded from its
Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h), the player shall

Team Salary pursuant to this Section 4(h) and such application is
granted, the Team will be prohibited from re-signing or re-
acquiring that player at any time, and (ii) if a Team makes a request
for an Exception to replace a Disabled Player pursuant to Section
6(c) below for a Salary Cap Year, then, whether such application is
