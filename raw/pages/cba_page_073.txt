                                                  Article II    51
             any practice, basketball drill, conditioning, workout,
             or other such activity with one or more players on
             the NBA Team under the direction and supervision
             of the NBA Team, or (iii) travels with or at the
             direction of (including remaining on the road with)
             the NBA Team, other than if the only travel during
             that day is return travel to the NBA Team’s home
             city that takes place between 12:00 midnight and
             1:00 a.m; provided, however, that a Two-Way
             Player will not accrue an NBA Day of Service for
             traveling between his NBADL team and NBA
             Team. For the avoidance of doubt, a Two-Way
             Player will not accrue an NBA Day of Service
             during NBA training camp or during the NBA
             playoffs.
     (B)     A Two-Way Player will accrue one day of service
             for an NBADL team (an “NBADL Day of
             Service”) for each calendar day during the NBADL
             Regular Season during which the Two-Way Player
             is not providing an NBA Day of Service. For the
             avoidance of doubt, a Two-Way Player will not
             accrue an NBADL Day of Service during NBADL
             training camp or during the NBADL playoffs.
(ii) No player under a Two-Way Contract may accrue more
     than forty-five (45) NBA Days of Service during an NBA
     Regular Season (the “45-Day Two-Way Service Limit”). If
     a player is signed to a Two-Way Contract after the start of
     the NBA Regular Season, the 45-Day Two-Way Service
     Limit shall be prorated such that the maximum allowable
     number of NBA Days of Service that the player may accrue
     shall be: forty-five (45) multiplied by a fraction, the
     numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the
     NBA Regular Season as of the date such Two-Way
     Contract is entered into, and the denominator of which is
     the total number of days of that NBA Regular Season,
     rounded up to the nearest whole number.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a player provides one or
     more NBA Days of Service before the first day of any
