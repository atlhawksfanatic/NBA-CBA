76      Article IV
respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to
the players. The costs of any such alternative arrangement shall be at an
annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams
substantially equal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that such
Teams would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the benefit
described in this Section 1, commencing on the date of termination. If
despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail
to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above,
such failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.
   (f) Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount. The
following amounts shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount
provided for by Section 8 below:
        (1) $4 million to be used in respect of the cost of the benefit
        increases described in Section 1(a)(2);
        (2) Fifty percent (50%) of the increase in the amount of the
        actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made for a Plan
        Year to the Pension Plan to fund the Normal Retirement Benefits
        for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension
        Plan over the amount of the actuarially determined annual
        contributions that would be required to be made for that Plan Year
        to the Pension Plan in order to fund the Normal Retirement
        Benefits for Pre-1965 Players described in Section 20.3(a)(iv) of the
        Pension Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of the Pension Plan never
        been in effect (the “Pre-1965 Player Cost Increase”);
        (3) Fifty percent (50%) of the costs incurred for a Plan Year in
        order to provide the excess portion of the benefit amount
        described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(v) under the Pre-1965
        Players Excess Benefit Plan over the costs that would be incurred
        for that Plan Year in order to provide for the excess portion of the
        benefit amount described in Pension Plan Section 20.3(a)(iv) under
        the Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan had Section 20.3(a)(v) of
        the Pension Plan never been in effect (the “Pre-1965 Player Excess
        Benefit Cost Increase”);
