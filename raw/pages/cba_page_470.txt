448   Article XXXIII
  (f) (i)     A First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to
              this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,
              notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time
              of his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”).
              Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section
              12(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty
              (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a
              stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the
              event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least
              the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the
              Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but
              not more than the Salary provided for in Section 12(f)(iii)
              below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall,
              for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be
              the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate
              and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a
              Player Contract with the previous Team within the year
              following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be
              deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First
              Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the
              player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
       (ii)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(f)(i)
              above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a
              Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves
              the notice required by Section 12(f)(i), he is under contract
              to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B)
              the player signs a contract with a professional basketball
              team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which
              the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i) and
              before the date on which the previous Team makes a
              Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled
              pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain
              tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team
              that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering
              playing services under a Player Contract with such Team,
              provided that such notice will not be effective until the
              player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to
              sign with and begin rendering playing services for such
              team.
