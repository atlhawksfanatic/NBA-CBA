                             TEAM RULES
Section 1.    Establishment of Team Rules.
    Each Team may maintain or establish rules with which its players shall
comply at all times, whether on or off the playing floor; provided,
however, that such rules are in writing, are reasonable, and do not violate
the provisions of this Agreement or the Uniform Player Contract.
Section 2.    Notice.
    Any rule(s) established by a Team pursuant to Section 1 above shall be
provided to the Players Association prior to the distribution of such rule(s)
to that Team’s players.
Section 3.    Grievances Challenging Team Rules.
    The Players Association may file a Grievance challenging the
reasonableness of a rule established by a Team pursuant to Section 1
above, and the Team’s imposition of discipline on a player for a violation
of such rule, within thirty (30) days from the date upon which the
imposition of such discipline on the player became known or reasonably
should have become known to the player. No ruling by the Grievance
Arbitrator finding a Team rule unreasonable may be applied retroactively
as to any player other than the player on whose behalf the Grievance was
filed.
