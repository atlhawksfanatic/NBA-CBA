    accordance with this Section 6(j)(3).
    (4) If a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early Qualifying
    Veteran Free Agent and his prior Team enter into a Player
    Contract, in accordance with Section 6(b)(1) or (3) above, in
    connection with an agreement to trade the Contract in accordance
    with Section 8(e) below, the Team’s Team Salary immediately
    following such Contract signing is above the Salary Cap, and the
    new Contract to be traded provides for a Salary for the first Season
    of such new Contract greater than one hundred twenty percent
    (120%) of the Salary for the last Season of the player’s immediately
    prior Contract (and greater than the Minimum Player Salary with

    deemed equal to the greater of (i) the Salary for the last Season of
    his preceding Contract, or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the Salary for
