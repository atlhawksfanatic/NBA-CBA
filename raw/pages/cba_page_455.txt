previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution
of a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment for use of a
Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this
Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth
in Section 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the
Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within
the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a
Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment other than in accordance
with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be
dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its
Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below,
notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing
procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the
Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed
marijuana or a SPED, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable
consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be.

will conduct no more than 1,525 total tests. During the Off-Season, the
NBA will conduct no more than 600 total tests. The scheduling of testing

player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the
NBA, the Players Association, any Team or any player will have any
involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice
of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation
of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector
for the same) to provide advance notice of a scheduled collection to an
NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not
identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access
of the collector to the testing location. Urine samples collected during the
Season will be tested for all Prohibited Substances; urine samples collected
during the Off-Season will be tested for SPEDs and Diuretics only and
