purpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which case
any finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear
preponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of decisions
in respect of which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA
Team shall conclusively be deemed reasonable: membership
location; arena capacity or configuration; number and location of
games played; whether to outsource or operate a line of business;
and whether to accept or decline a sponsorship, advertising or
naming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall not limit in any
manner the circumstances in which the business judgment of the
NBA or an NBA Team may be deemed reasonable.
(10) The parties agree that upon a finding by the System Arbitrator
(which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel) that the
NBA or an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully failed to
provide to the Accountants information concerning revenues or
expenses material to the Accountantsâ€™ preparation of an Audit
Report, and that such failure to provide information resulted in an
understatement of BRI of more than $4,232,345 with respect to
the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four and one-half
percent (4.5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year of this
Agreement, beginning with the 2018-19 Salary Cap Year), then the
amount by which BRI was understated shall be included in BRI in
the Salary Cap Year in which such finding is made, with interest
accruing from the date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year
in which such amount would have been included but for such
understatement, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year
Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date
of the issuance of such Audit Report). In addition, if any Team, or
if the NBA, violates the foregoing, it shall be fined $3 million for
its first violation during the term of this Agreement and an
additional $1.5 million for each additional violation. (For example,
if a Team violates the foregoing for the first time, it shall be fined
$3 million; if such Team violates the foregoing a second time, it
shall be fined $4.5 million; and if such Team violates the foregoing
a third time, it shall be fined $6 million.) Fifty percent (50%) of
any such fine amounts shall be remitted by the NBA to an NBPA-
Selected Charitable Organization (as defined in Article VI, Section
6 above) and fifty percent (50%) shall be remitted by the NBA to a
Section 501(c)(3) organization selected by the NBA.
