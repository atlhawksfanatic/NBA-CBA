                                                             Exhibit A     A-33
         (i)     The Base Compensation, if any, owed to the Player
                 pursuant to this Exhibit 2 with respect to the “current
                 season” (as defined below) at the time when the request for
                 waivers on the Player is made shall be paid in accordance
                 with the payment schedule set forth in this Contract. Each
                 installment shall equal the amount of Base Compensation
                 that was due per pay period immediately before the Player’s
                 separation until the aggregate amount of the remaining
                 Base Compensation owed to the Player pursuant to this
                 Exhibit 2 with respect to the current season is paid in full.
                 For purposes of this Paragraph 2 only, the “current
                 season” means the period from September 1 through June
                 30.
         (ii)    The remaining Base Compensation, if any, owed to the
                 Player pursuant to this Exhibit 2 shall be aggregated and
                 paid in equal amounts per year over a period equal to twice
                 the number of NBA Seasons (including any Season
                 covered by a Player Option Year) remaining on this
                 Contract following the date upon which the request for
                 waivers occurred, plus one NBA Season. For this purpose,
                 if the request for waivers is made during the period from
                 September 1 through June 30, the number of NBA Seasons
                 remaining on this Contract shall not include the current
                 season (as defined in subparagraph (i) above). The
                 rescheduled payments described above shall be paid over
                 the applicable number of NBA Seasons in equal semi-
                 monthly installments on the pay dates prescribed by
                 Paragraph 3(a) of this Contract.
For purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, each
installment of the amount payable pursuant to this Exhibit 2 shall be
treated as a separate payment.
