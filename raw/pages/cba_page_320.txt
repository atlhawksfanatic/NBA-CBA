298     Article XI
         (iii)  In the event the player does not pass the requested physical
                examination, then in its sole discretion, the ROFR Team
                may withdraw its First Refusal Exercise Notice within two
                (2) days following the date upon which such physical
                examination is conducted. If the First Refusal Exercise
                Notice is withdrawn, the player and the New Team shall be
                deemed to have entered into a Player Contract in
                accordance with the provisions of Section 5(g) above. If
                the First Refusal Exercise Notice is not withdrawn, then
                the ROFR Team shall be deemed to have waived its right
                to have the player pass a physical examination and will be
                deemed to have entered into a Player Contract in
                accordance with the provisions of Section 5(g) above.

New Team determines that the player has not passed the physical, and (ii)
either (A) the ROFR Team declines to exercise its Right of First Refusal,

expires, or (C) the ROFR Team exercises its Right of First Refusal
conditioned on the player reporting for and passing a physical and timely
determines that the player has not passed his physical and withdraws its
First Refusal Exercise Notice pursuant to Section 5(k) above, then the
ROFR Team must within two (2) days from the later of the date (x) that
the ROFR Team receives notice from the New Team that the player has
not passed the physical examination administered by the New Team, or (y)
on which the ROFR Team timely notifies the player that he has not passed
the physical, pursuant to Section 5(k) above:
         (i)    Elect to continue to possess such rights with respect to the
                player as the ROFR Team possessed at the time of the
                execution of the Offer Sheet, provided that the ROFR
                Team can only make this election if the ROFR Team has
                not engaged in any transaction since the Offer Sheet was
                given that the ROFR Team would not have been able to
                engage in if the player’s Free Agent Amount (or the
                amount of a Qualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying
                Offer made to the player, if applicable) at the time the
