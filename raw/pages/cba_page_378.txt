                 the Contract (the “Waiving Team Base

                 as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1
                 following the award of the player’s Contract to the
                 Claiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.
                 If a Claiming Team trades a player awarded as a
                 result of a Partial Waiver Claim (after the waiting
                 period set forth in the preceding sentence), the
                 acquiring Team: (i) must have room (or a Traded
                 Player Exception in accordance with the rules set
                 forth in Article VII, Section 6(j)) in an amount
                 equal to at least the Claiming Team Base
