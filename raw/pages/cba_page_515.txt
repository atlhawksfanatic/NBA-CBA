                                                              Exhibit A    A-11
this Contract (or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no
further force or effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be
relieved of their respective rights and liabilities thereunder, provided that
such ten (10) day period shall be fifteen (15) days for any Contract (or
amendment) so received during the period each year from July 1 through
the date that is fourteen (14) days following the last day of the Moratorium
Period. If the Commissioner’s disapproval is subsequently overturned in
any proceeding brought under the arbitration provisions of the CBA

the Team and the Player, and the Commissioner shall be afforded another
ten-day period to disapprove the Contract (based on the Team’s Room at
the time the Commissioner’s disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the
foregoing sentence. The NBA will inform the Players Association if the
Commissioner disapproves this Contract (or any amendment(s) thereto)
no later than one (1) day following the date of such disapproval.
