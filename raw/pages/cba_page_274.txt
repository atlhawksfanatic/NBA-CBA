252 Article VII
    (4) After November 8, the NBA shall periodically update the
    Escrow Schedules to add Escrow Amounts for players (other than
    Two-Way Players) who enter into new Player Contracts and to
    make such adjustments as may be necessary to previously-listed
    Escrow Amounts (such as adjustments resulting from earned
    Performance Bonuses, Contract terminations, Renegotiations, etc.).
    Any portion of a Base Escrow Amount that has not been deducted
    as of the date any such updated Schedules are prepared shall be
    deducted in equal installments from each of the remaining semi-
    monthly Compensation payments to be made to the player from
    November 15 through May 1 of the applicable Salary Cap Year.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 12(c)(4) shall not apply
    to the procedures for Two-Way Contracts, which are provided for
    in Section 12(c)(2) and (3) above.
    (5) Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Escrow
    Schedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event
    that the Players Association believes warrants a change in any
    previously-issued Schedules, the Players Association may bring a
    proceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance with
    Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA’s calculation of any
    player’s Escrow Amount for such Salary Cap Year.
    Notwithstanding the commencement of any such proceeding, each
    Team shall commence and continue remitting to the Escrow Agent
    the total deductions due with respect to each Deduction Date and
    each Performance Bonus Deduction Date as set forth in the
    Schedules, and in no event shall any Team be prohibited from
    remitting to the Escrow Agent any such deduction prior to a final
    determination in any such proceeding.
    (6) In the event that the NBA makes a determination in
    accordance with Section 12(c)(4) above, or a final determination is
    made in a proceeding in accordance with Section 12(c)(5) above,
    that an Escrow Amount was erroneously calculated by the NBA,
    the sole remedy with respect to any amounts erroneously deducted
    from the player’s Salary shall be to modify, as soon as practicable,
    the deduction schedule applicable to such player so as to reduce, in
    equal amounts, all scheduled future deductions from post-
    determination payments of Compensation until the amount of any
    prior over-deduction is fully off-set; provided, however, that to the
