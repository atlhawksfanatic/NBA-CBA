                                                      Article VII     155
    (iii)   To the extent salary paid to a person who also owns an
            interest in the Team would otherwise be deductible from
            BRI, such salary shall only be deductible for BRI purposes
            only if all of the following criteria are met and if the
            expense otherwise qualifies for such deduction (for
            example, without limitation, the salary is related to the BRI
            against which it is deducted): (i) the owner owns less than
            seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Team, (ii) the job
            being performed by the owner would otherwise be
            performed by a non-owner staff member, (iii) the job being
            performed by the owner is his/her full time job and he/she
            has no other roles with outside companies (with the
            exception of limited duty Board roles), (iv) the salary being
            earned is reasonable and customary, relative to what a non-
            owner staff member would earn, for the services being
            provided, and (v) there are no other individuals performing
            substantially the same role employed by the Team where
            the role is such that ordinarily there is only one person
            performing it (for example, without limitation, Team
            president).
    (iv)    With respect to expenses associated with League-related
            entity advertising and public relations campaigns: (i) the
            expenses will be allocated to BRI and non-BRI revenue
            categories according to the methodology agreed to by the
            parties in connection with the final Audit Report for the
            2015-16 Salary Cap Year, except that such expenses shall
            also be allocated to the NBAâ€™s Regular Season gate
            assessment during the Salary Cap Year in addition to the
            other categories previously included in the allocation; and
            (ii) the expenses shall be deducted from BRI, subject to
            Section 1(a)(6)(ii) above.
(b) Accounting Methods/Lump Sum Payments.
    (1) Subject to Sections 1(b)(2) and (b)(3) below, and any
    provision hereof that expressly provides for an alternative
