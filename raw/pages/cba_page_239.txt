                                                   Article VII   217
Contract. A Player Contract covering a term of one (1) or two (2)
Seasons (including any Option Year) may not be extended. If a
player and Team seek to enter into an Extension pursuant to this
Section 7(a) (other than a Designated Veteran Player Extension in
accordance with Section 7(a)(3)(ii) below) more than one (1) year
prior to the July 1 preceding the first Season covered by the
extended term, then the Extension may only be negotiated and
entered into during the off-season (i.e., during the period from July
1 through the day prior to the first day of a Regular Season).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Player Contract may be extended
pursuant to the Designated Veteran Player Extension rules set
forth in Article II, Section 7 and Section 7(a)(3)(ii) below no
sooner than the third anniversary of the signing of the Contract,
and Designated Veteran Player Extensions may only be negotiated
and entered into during the off-season. For purposes of
determining the second or third anniversary of the signing of an
Extension pursuant to this Section 7(a)(1), Extensions entered into
during the period from October 2 through the day prior to the first
day of the Regular Season (or, for Extensions entered into prior to
the execution of this Agreement, during the period from October 2
through November 2) of a Salary Cap Year shall be deemed to
have been signed on October 1 of such Salary Cap Year.
(2) (i) A Player Contract that has been renegotiated to provide for
        an increase in Salary in any Salary Cap Year covered by the
        Contract of more than ten percent (10%) of the player’s
        Salary prior to the Renegotiation, may not subsequently be
        extended until the third anniversary of the signing of such
        Renegotiation.
(ii)    A Team and a player shall not be permitted to extend any
        Player Contract with a term that has been shortened as a
        result of the player’s exercise of an Early Termination
        Option.
(iii)   Subject to the rules set forth in this Section 7(a): (i) a
        Contract may be extended following the exercise of an
        Option by a player or Team; and (ii) a Contract may be
        extended following the non-exercise of an Option by a
        player or Team only if:
