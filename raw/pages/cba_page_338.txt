   (d) conduct authorized by the terms and conditions of the NBA Draft
(as set forth in Article X above);
   (e) conduct authorized by any provision of this Agreement or conduct
by the NBA League Office, undertaken in good faith, that reflects a
reasonable interpretation of this Agreement or a Player Contract;
   (f) any action taken by the NBA League Office to exclude from the
NBA, suspend or discipline any player for any reason authorized or
permitted by any provision of this Agreement (this Section 2(f), however,
shall not affect any other rights of any player or the Players Association to
contest such action); or
   (g) any disapproval by the NBA Commissioner of a Player Contract,
Extension, Renegotiation or other amendment.
Section 3.     Individual Negotiations.
   No NBA Team shall fail or refuse to negotiate with, or enter into a
Player Contract with, any player who is free to negotiate and sign a Player
Contract with any NBA Team, on any of the following grounds:
   (a) that the player has previously been subject to the exclusive
negotiating rights obtained by another NBA Team in an NBA Draft; or
   (b) that the player has previously refused or failed to enter into a
Player Contract containing an Option; or
   (c) that the player has become a Restricted Free Agent or an
Unrestricted Free Agent; or
   (d) that the player is or has been subject to a Right of First Refusal.
   The fact that a Team has not negotiated with, made any offers to, or
entered into any Player Contracts with players who are free to negotiate
and sign Player Contracts with any Team, shall not, by itself, be deemed
proof that such Team failed or refused to negotiate with, make any offers
to, or enter into any Player Contracts with any players on any of the
prohibited grounds referred to in this Section 3.
