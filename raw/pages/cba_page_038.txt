16       Article II
    (a) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Compensation to be paid or
amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract for
rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such
Contract.
    (b) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses, and the
payment date for each such bonus, to be paid as a result of: (i) the player’s
execution of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a “signing bonus”);
(ii) the player’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his
performance as a player or the Team’s performance during a particular
NBA Season, subject to the limitations imposed by paragraph 3(c) of the
Uniform Player Contract and Section 12(c) below; or (iii) the player’s
achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his physical condition
or academic achievement (e.g., earning a college degree or completion of a
certified leadership training program), including the player’s attendance at
and participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season
skill and/or conditioning program upon terms and conditions agreed upon
by the Team and player (subject to the provisions of Section 12(b) below).
Any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of this
Section 3(b) must be structured so as to provide an incentive for positive
achievement by the player and/or the Team; and any amendment agreed
upon pursuant to subsection (ii) must be based upon specific numerical
benchmarks or Generally Recognized League Honors. By way of example
and not limitation, an amendment agreed upon pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii)
may provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage
exceeds eighty percent (80%), but may not provide for the player to
receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage improves over his previous
Season’s percentage. For purposes of any bonus agreed upon pursuant to
subsection (ii), the performance benchmarks must be based solely upon
official NBA statistics, and the determination of whether a player has
earned any such performance bonus shall be made solely by reference to
official NBA statistics as published on NBA.com.
    (c) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a
Uniform Player Contract) with respect to extra promotional appearances
to be performed by the player (in addition to those required by paragraph
13 of such Contract) and the Compensation therefor.
