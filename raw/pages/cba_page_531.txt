                                                            Exhibit A   A-27
following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season
shall govern.
   (b) If the winning percentage of two (2) claiming Teams are the same,
then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular
Season Games between the two (2) Teams during the Season or during the
preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall
determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both
Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a
consolidated standing shall control.
    5.06.       Players Acquired Through Waivers. A Member who has
acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver
procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days
after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such
Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein
shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season.
    5.07.       Additional Waiver Rules. The Commissioner or the Board of
Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to
those set forth in this Section 5) with respect to the operation of the
waiver procedure. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions
of this Section 5 and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the
mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member,
and rules of construction as to time.
