                                                           Article IV         81
application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law,
or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations
(whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under
the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement would
result in the 401(k) Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and
above any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of
this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for
the 401(k) Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of
the Code (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in
connection with the provision of benefits to their non-player employees or
to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections
414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to
maintain or make contributions to the 401(k) Plan pursuant to this
Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall
terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair
the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the
legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective
bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right: (i) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of 401(k) benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players Association agree
to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be
provided by the NBA Teams to the players. Any such alternative
arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis)
to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater than the annual
cost that such Teams would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with
respect to Matching Contributions and Two-Way Matching Contributions
commencing on the date of termination. The cost of any such alternative
arrangement shall: (A) be applied against the New Benefit Amount
provided by Section 8 below, and (B) be limited to the portion of the New
Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to
Section 8(b)(2) below. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the
Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement
as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (x) to
unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms
concerning the provision of 401(k) benefits to the players; (y) to lockout;
or (z) to strike.
