                                                      Article XXVIII      381
modify such creative elements (“Cure”). If the NBA fails to Cure pursuant
to the preceding sentence, then the Players Association may sue the NBA
for any resulting damages to the Players Association’s commercial group
licensing business, with the NBA responsible for the violation and such
damages even if the NBA did not authorize such promotional opportunity.
    (g) For purposes of clarity, nothing contained in this Article XXVIII
or in Paragraph 14 of the Uniform Player Contract shall prohibit the
inclusion of a sponsor’s name and/or logo on a jersey patch, and any
depiction of a player wearing a jersey that includes such a jersey patch shall
not, by reason of the jersey patch alone, constitute an unauthorized
Endorsement, an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion, or a violation of
Section 3(f) above.
Section 4.    Reservation of Rights.
    The Players Association expressly reserves its rights to bargain
collectively on the subject described in Section 1 above at the expiration of
this Agreement. Such reservation shall not, however, preclude the NBA
from contending that the subject described in Section 1 above is not a
mandatory subject of collective bargaining. The right of the NBA, League
related entities, and NBA Teams described in Section 1 above is in
addition to, and shall not limit nor be deemed to limit, derogate from or
otherwise prejudice, any and all rights that any one or all of them have
heretofore possessed or enjoyed, do now possess or enjoy or may hereafter
possess or enjoy.
