                                                     Article XXXIII    451
        (iii)  A Veteran Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section
               12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team
               that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first
               Season of up to the player’s Salary and Unlikely Bonuses,
               respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was
               dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if
               the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season),
               even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary
               Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a
               Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the
               previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such
               Contract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and
               decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season
               shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(i); provided,
               however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed
               and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale
               Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player’s
               new Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons
               (including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that
               remained under the player’s Rookie Scale Contract at the
               time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary
               called for in any Season of the Player’s new Contract
               (including any Option Year), may not exceed the Salary
               called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie
               Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms
               identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the
               player’s Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed
               and disqualified, and the player’s Team ultimately exercises
               the Option Year available under the new Contract, then
               such Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such
               new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI
               following the completion of the player’s Rookie Scale
               Contract.
Section 13. Exclusivity of the Program.
   (a) Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be
no other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the
NBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing;
provided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test
