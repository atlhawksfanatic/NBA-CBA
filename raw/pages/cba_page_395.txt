                                                        Article XXVII       373
                                ARTICLE XXVII
                             RIGHT OF SET-OFF
Section 1.        Set-off Calculation.
    (a) When a Team (“First Team”) terminates a Player Contract (“First
Contract”) in circumstances where the First Team, following the
termination, continues to be liable for unearned Base Compensation (i.e.,
unearned as of the date of the termination) called for by the First Contract
(including any unearned Deferred Base Compensation), the First Team’s
liability for such unearned Base Compensation shall be reduced pro rata by
a portion of the compensation earned by the player (for services as a
player) from any professional basketball team or teams (the “Subsequent
Team(s)”) during each Salary Cap Year covered by the term of the First
Contract (including, but not limited to, compensation earned but not paid
during such period). The amount of the reduction in the First Team’s
liability (the “set-off” amount) shall be calculated for each Salary Cap Year
covered by the term of the First Contract as follows:
STEP 1: Calculate the total compensation earned by the player (for
            services as a player) from the Subsequent Team(s) during the
            Salary Cap Year.
STEP 2: Subtract from the result in Step 1 (i) if the player had zero (0)
            Years of Service at the time the First Contract was terminated,
            the Minimum Annual Salary applicable to such player for the
            Salary Cap Year in which the First Contract was terminated, or
            (ii) if the player had one (1) or more Years of Service at the time
            the First Contract was terminated, the Minimum Annual Salary
            applicable to a player with one (1) Year of Service for the Salary
            Cap Year in which the First Contract was terminated.
STEP 3: If the result in Step 2 is zero or a negative amount, there is no
            reduction in the First Team’s liability for unearned Base
            Compensation in respect of the relevant Salary Cap Year. If the
            result in Step 2 is a positive amount, the reduction in the First
            Team’s liability for unearned Base Compensation in respect of
            the relevant Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty percent (50%) of
            such amount.
