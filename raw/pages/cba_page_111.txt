                                                            Article IV     89
        hiring an academic advisor or career counselor to assist with player
        outreach and similar functions with respect to the tuition
        reimbursement and career transition program set forth in Section
        3(a)(7).
    (c) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan shall permit participation by Toronto Players on the
same basis as players who are not Toronto Players; provided, however,
that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the HRA Benefit for the
period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but shall
instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7
below. If the NBA and the Players Association determine that the Health
and Welfare Benefit Plan cannot provide one or more of the benefits
described in Section 3(a) to Toronto Players (1) that are substantially
equivalent to the benefits provided to players employed by Teams located
in the United States or (2) on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal
income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in
good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by
Toronto to the Toronto Players. The annual cost incurred by the Teams
in connection with any such alternative arrangement (as determined on an
after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would
have incurred to fund the applicable benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) for
such Toronto Player. The cost to Toronto of funding an alternative
arrangement to the HRA Benefit shall be applied against the New Benefit
Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and shall be limited to the
portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this
purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below. The cost to Toronto of
funding any alternative arrangement(s) to any of the benefit(s) described in
Section 3(a) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association
fail to agree with respect to any alternative arrangement(s) as described
above, such failure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally
implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the
provision of benefits provided or to be provided by the Health and
Welfare Benefit Plan; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.
    (d) Deductibility of Contributions/Regulatory Changes.
