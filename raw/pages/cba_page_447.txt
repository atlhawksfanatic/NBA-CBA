                                                Article XXXIII      425
(e) (i)    The NBA and the Players Association shall form a
           Prohibited Substance Committee, which shall be comprised
           of one (1) representative from the NBA, one (1)
           representative from the Players Association, and three (3)
           individuals jointly selected by the NBA and the Players
           Association who shall be experts in the field of testing and
           treatment for drugs of abuse and performance-enhancing
           substances. The members of this Committee shall serve
           for the duration of the Agreement.
     (ii)  The members of the Prohibited Substances Committee
           shall meet (either in person or by conference call) at least
           once each Season and once each off-season (the “Annual
           Meetings”). The Annual Meetings shall be scheduled by
           the NBA after consultation with the Players Association.
           At the Annual Meetings, the Committee shall review the
           Program’s list of Prohibited Substances, and discuss
           general anti-doping issues (including, but not limited to,
           advances in drug testing science and technology, and
           modifications to relevant anti-doping policies of other
           sports organizations). The Committee shall also make
           recommendations to the NBA and NBPA for changes to
           the list of Prohibited Substances (including the
           determination of laboratory analysis cutoff levels).
     (iii) As of September 1, 2017, and as of each successive
           September 1, either of the parties to this Agreement may
           discharge any jointly-selected member of the Prohibited
           Substances Committee by serving thirty (30) days’ prior
           notice upon that person and upon the other party to this
           Agreement. In the case of such discharge, or in the event a
           Committee member resigns, and if the parties are unable to
           agree on a replacement Committee member within thirty
           (30) days, then the parties shall request a list of seven (7)
           names of potential replacements prepared by the Medical
           Director and any remaining jointly-selected Committee
           members, and, within seven (7) days, shall select the
           necessary replacement by alternately striking names from
           the list until only one (1) remains.
