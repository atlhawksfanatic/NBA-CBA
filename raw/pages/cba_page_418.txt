396     Article XXXI
   (c) If a Grievance is scheduled for hearing under this Article XXXI,
and the hearing date is thereafter postponed at the request of either the
NBA or the Players Association, the postponement fee (if any) of the
Grievance Arbitrator will be borne by the party requesting the
postponement, unless that party objects and the Grievance Arbitrator finds
that the request for such postponement was for good cause. Should good
cause be found, the parties will share any postponement fee equally.
   (d) In any Grievance matter, neither the NBA nor the Players
Association may request or be granted more than one (1) postponement of
a hearing previously scheduled under this Article XXXI. If a party which
has been granted a postponement of a hearing fails to attend a
subsequently scheduled hearing in the same Grievance matter, the
Grievance shall be resolved against that party.
   (e) If (i) a hearing of a Grievance is not scheduled to take place within
one (1) year from the initiation of the Grievance, or (ii) in the circumstance
where the initial date set for the hearing has been postponed, if a second
hearing in that Grievance is not scheduled to take place within two (2)
years from the initiation of the Grievance, then the Grievance shall, upon
written notice to the party or parties filing such Grievance, be deemed to
have been dismissed with prejudice as of the thirtieth (30th) day following
the delivery of such notice without the need for a hearing or for any action
to be taken or decision to be issued by the Grievance Arbitrator, unless,
upon written application made by the party or parties filing such Grievance
within such thirty-day period, the Grievance Arbitrator determines that
dismissal of the Grievance without prejudice would be unjust.
   (f) For purposes of computing time under this Section 4, the time
shall be tolled during any period when there is no Grievance Arbitrator or
when the grieving party has been unable to schedule a hearing (after
making efforts to do so) because the Grievance Arbitrator is unavailable.
   (g) Hearings before the Grievance Arbitrator shall be held in New
York (alternating between the NBA and Players Association offices). All
such hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Labor Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that in
the event of any conflict between such Rules and the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.
