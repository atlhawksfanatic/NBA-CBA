354 Article XXII
            value of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to
            Section 6 of the NBA By-Laws. A “Partial Waiver Claim”
            is a discount bid of a single dollar amount (rounded to the
            nearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining
            term of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for
            any amount equal to or greater than the total of the
            applicable Minimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining
            Protected Years (as defined below) of the Contract and less
            than the total of the full Base Compensation provided for
            in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract,
            provided that a Partial Waiver Claim may never be less
            than the total of the unprotected Base Compensation
            provided for in all of the Remaining Protected Years of the
            Contract. A “Remaining Protected Year” means any
            remaining year of the Contract that contains any amount of
            Base Compensation protection that is not contingent on
            some event occurring on a date after the request for
            waivers; any remaining years of the Contract that are not
            Remaining Protected Years shall hereinafter be referred to
            as “Remaining Unprotected Years.” For clarity, any Player
            Option Year in which the Contract includes the language in
            Article XII, Section 2(a)(A) and the Effective Season of
            (and any subsequent year to) an ETO shall be a Remaining
            Protected Year, and any Player Option Year in which the
            Contract that includes the language in Article XII, Section
            2(a)(B) and any Team Option Year shall not.
     (iii)  In order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must
            have a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal
            to at least the portion of the Claiming Team Base
            Compensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A)
            below) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year
            of the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For
            purposes of the preceding sentence, “room” includes room
            that can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g.,
            via renouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and such
            room must be created immediately upon the awarding of
            the player pursuant to this waiver procedure.
