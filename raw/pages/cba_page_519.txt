                                                            Exhibit A     A-15
promotion of the third party’s products and services (it being understood
that this clause (y) does not apply to an execution that includes the third
party’s brand name and/or logo, but clause (x) above does apply).
   (d) In addition to Paragraph 14(c)(i) above, solely for the current term
of the contracts in effect as of the execution date of the CBA, between the
NBA, any League-related entity, or any NBA Team, on the one hand, and
ABC/ESPN, TNT, or any regional, local or international telecasters or
