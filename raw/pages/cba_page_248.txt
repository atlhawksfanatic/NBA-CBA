226     Article VII
                                            the preceding Salary Cap Year
                                            to the current Salary Cap Year
   For purposes of this Section 8(a), (i) if a Contract is signed and then
traded pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) below, and the Contract contains a
signing bonus, the payment of all or any portion of such bonus by the
Team that signed the Contract shall be treated as a reimbursement of a
Compensation obligation of the assignee Team and shall be subject to this
Section 8(a), and (ii) the amounts paid or received by a Team in connection
with one (1) or more trades occurring during a Salary Cap Year shall not be
netted against each other (thus, for example, if Team A pays $5.1 million in
connection with one (1) trade occurring during the 2017-18 Salary Cap
Year and receives $5.1 million from another Team in connection with
either the same or a subsequent trade occurring during the same Salary
Cap Year, Team A would be unable to either pay or receive any cash in
connection with any subsequent trades that it makes during that Salary Cap
Year).
   (b) A player (other than a Two-Way Player) with a one-year Contract
(excluding any Option Year) who would be a Qualifying Veteran Free
Agent or an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent upon completing the
playing services called for under his Contract cannot be traded without the
player’s consent. Should the player consent and be traded, then, for
purposes of determining whether the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free
Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Non-Qualifying Veteran
Free Agent at the conclusion of the Contract or any subsequent Contract
between the player and the assignee Team, the player shall be considered
as having changed Teams by means of signing a Contract with the assignee
Team as a Free Agent (and not by means of trade). For clarity, a player’s
right to consent to be traded under this Section 8(b) shall continue
following the initial trade of the player’s Contract and any proposed
subsequent trade of such Contract during the term thereof (not including
any Option Year).
   (c) A Team cannot trade any player after the NBA trade deadline
occurring in the last Season of the player’s Contract, or after the NBA
trade deadline occurring in any Season that could be the last Season of the
player’s Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or
Early Termination Option.
