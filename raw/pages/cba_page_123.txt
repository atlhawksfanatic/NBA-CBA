                                                             Article IV    101
         Payment of the amount necessary to fund such programs in
         respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30)
         days following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary
         Cap Year. The NBA and Players Association agree that, subject to
         the limitations set forth in this Section 5, the amount to be paid by
         the Teams to fund the health education programs (or any programs
         that, pursuant to Section 5(f) below, are substituted for the health
         education programs) to be operated and administered by the
         Education Trust for the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year shall be no
         greater than $469,033 and such maximum funding amount shall be
         increased by five percent (5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap
         Year.
   (d) The Education Trust shall be operated and administered in a
manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully
deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax
laws) when paid. If any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in
part) for such contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise,
the obligation to maintain the Education Trust and to make further
contributions to the Education Trust shall immediately terminate;
provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally
binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement, and shall not
create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this
Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of education programs
provided or to be provided by the Education Trust; (2) to lockout; or (3)
to strike.
   (e) In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 5(d) above, the
NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to
an alternative arrangement designed to provide the programs described in
the Education Trust Agreement. Such alternative arrangement shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then
remain in the Education Trust and, if the monies remaining in the
Education Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such
purpose, such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the NBA
Teams; provided, however, that the annual cost incurred by the Teams in
connection with such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-
tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have
incurred to fund the Education Trust commencing on the date of
termination. Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and
