Section 5. Minimum League-Wide Roster.
(a) If for two consecutive Regular Seasons, NBA Teams in the
aggregate employ an average of less than fourteen and one-quarter (14.25)
players (excluding Two-Way Players) per Team, then for each Regular
Season covered by this Agreement that follows such consecutive two-year
period:
(i) The requirement set forth in Section 2(a) above that each
Team have either fourteen (14) or fifteen (15) players, in
aggregate, on its Active and Inactive List shall be modified
so that each Team would for the remainder of the term of
this Agreement be required to have fifteen (15) players, in
aggregate, on its Active and Inactive List; and
(ii) The rule set forth in Section 2(b)(i) above allowing a Team

aggregate, on its Active List and Inactive List for such time
periods (Sections 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) together, the
"League-Wide Roster Increase").
(b) If for two consecutive Regular Seasons, NBA Teams in the
aggregate employ an average of less than fourteen and one-half (14.5) players
(excluding Two-Way Players) per Team, then the Players Association shall
have the option, exercisable within forty-five (45) days following the last dayof the second of such two consecutive Regular Seasons, to amend Article II,
Section 11(b)(i) above such that, beginning on the first day of the
immediately following Salary Cap Year and continuing through the
remaining term of this Agreement, no Team would be permitted to have on
its roster at any one time more than two (2) Two-Way Players ("PA Third
Two-Way Option").
(c) The rules set forth in Sections 5(a) and 5(b) above shall be measured
following each Regular Season as follows:
STEP 1: For each player signed to a Standard NBA Contract
(including a Rest-of-Season or 10-Day Contract) during a
Regular Season, determine the number of days during such
Regular Season that such player was carried on his Team's
Active List or Inactive List (hereinafter "Duty Days").
STEP 2: Determine the total Duty Days for all players for such
Regular Season by adding together the results for each
player from Step 1.
STEP 3: Multiply (x) the number of NBA Teams that played games
during the applicable Regular Season, by (y) the number of
days during the Regular Season, by (z) fourteen and
one-quarter (14.25) or fourteen and one-half (14.5), as
applicable.
STEP 4: If, for two consecutive Regular Seasons, the result in
Step 2 above is less than the applicable result in Step 3
above, then the League-Wide Roster Increase and/or PA
Third Two-Way Option, as applicable, will be triggered.
Section 6. Games Played Requirement for Certain League Honors.
(a) Award Eligibility. No player shall be eligible for NBA Most
Valuable Player, NBA Defensive Player of the Year, NBA Most Improved
Player, All-NBA Team (First, Second, or Third), or NBA All-Defensive
Team (First or Second) honors (the "Applicable Generally Recognized
League Honors") for a Season unless the player has satisfied at least one of
the following criteria (the "Award Eligibility Criteria") in respect of such
Season: (1) the player played in at least sixty-five (65) Regular Season games;
or (2) the player (A) played in at least sixty-two (62) Regular Season games,(B) suffered a "season-ending injury" (as defined below), and (C) played in
at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the Regular Season games played by his
Team prior to the player suffering such injury.
(i) For purposes of this Section 6, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement:
(A) A "season-ending injury" is an injury that, in the
opinion of a physician jointly selected by the NBA
and Players Association, makes it substantially more
likely than not that the player would be unable to
play through the May 31 following the date of such
injury; and
(B) A player shall be considered to have played in a
Regular Season game if he played at least twenty (20)
minutes of such game, provided that in respect of no
more than two (2) Regular Season games per Season,
such player will be considered to have played in a
Regular Season game if he played at least fifteen (15)
minutes and fewer than twenty (20) minutes in such
game.
(ii) A player who fails to satisfy the Award Eligibility Criteria in
a Season may nonetheless be deemed eligible for the
Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors if he
prevails in either an Award Eligibility Grievance or an
Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge in respect of such
Season in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Sections 6(b) and 6(c) below. A player may not bring both
an Award Eligibility Grievance and an Extraordinary
Circumstances Challenge in respect of the same Season.
(b) Award Eligibility Grievance.
(i) To prevail in an Award Eligibility Grievance in respect of a
Season, the player bears the burden of proving, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the Team willfully limited the
player's number of minutes played or games played during
the Regular Season with the intention of depriving the playerof eligibility for one or more of the Applicable Generally
Recognized League Honors for such Season. If the player
satisfies the burden and prevails in the proceeding, the sole
remedy shall be that the player is deemed eligible for the
Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors. For
clarity, neither the foregoing sentence nor anything else in
this Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect the right of the
NBA to impose discipline on a Team for conduct prejudicial
or detrimental to the best interests of the NBA in the event
a player prevails in an Award Eligibility Grievance against
such Team.
(ii) Award Eligibility Grievances shall be heard by the System
Arbitrator.
(iii) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Section 6(b) shall
apply to the resolution of Award Eligibility Grievances. If
in connection with such disputes, there is any conflict
between the procedures set forth in this Section 6(b) and
those set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the procedures
set forth in this Section shall control.
(iv) A player may only bring an Award Eligibility Grievance in
respect of a Season if being awarded one of the Applicable
Generally Recognized League Honors in such Season could
impact whether the player is or could become eligible:
(A) Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(a)(i), to enter into a
Contract or Extension with a Maximum Annual
Salary in the first year covered by the Contract or
extended term, as applicable, in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Salary Cap by virtue of
satisfying the Higher Max Criteria;
(B) Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(a)(ii), to enter into a
Designated Veteran Player Contract; or
(C) Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(e), to enter into a
Designated Veteran Player Extension.(v) An Award Eligibility Grievance must be brought by a player
within two (2) days of the date on which it becomes
mathematically impossible for the player to play sixty-five
(65) Regular Season games in a Season; provided, however,
that any such Grievance must be initiated no later than
11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day following the last day of
the Regular Season.
(vi) A player may initiate an Award Eligibility Grievance against
a Team by serving a written notice thereof on the Team, with
a copy of such written notice to be filed with the System
Arbitrator, the Players Association, and the NBA. Such
written notice shall be accompanied by a witness list,
relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on
which the player intends to rely in his affirmative case. No
later than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date
on which the Team received written notice of the Award
Eligibility Grievance, the Team shall provide to the player,
the NBA, and the Players Association a witness list, relevant
documents, and other evidentiary materials on which the
Team intends to rely in its affirmative case. Absent a
showing of good cause, no party may proffer, refer to, or
rely on the testimony of any witness, document, or other
evidentiary material in its affirmative case that has not been
identified to the other side as required by this
Section 6(b)(vi).
(vii) The System Arbitrator shall convene a hearing at the earliest
possible time, but in no event later than two (2) days
following the System Arbitrator's receipt of notice of the
Award Eligibility Grievance. The hearing shall take place by
videoconference and shall last no longer than one (1) day.
The Players Association, the NBA, and the player and Team
that are parties to the proceeding shall each have the right to
participate in the hearing.
(viii) The System Arbitrator shall render a decision not later than
the day following the date of the hearing, and the decision
shall be accompanied by a written opinion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the System Arbitrator determines thatexpedition so requires, he/she shall accompany the decision
with a written summary of the grounds upon which the
decision is based, and a full written opinion may follow
within a reasonable time thereafter. The decision of the
System Arbitrator shall constitute full, final, and complete
disposition of the dispute and shall be binding upon the
parties to this Agreement, and the player and Team that are
parties to the proceeding, and there shall be no appeal to the
Appeals Panel.
(ix) Should circumstances warrant, each of the deadlines set
forth in this Section 6(b) may be reasonably modified by
agreement of the NBA and Players Association.
(c) Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge.
(i) To prevail in an Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge in
respect of a Season, the player bears the burden of proving
that:
(A) Due to extraordinary circumstances, it was
impracticable for him to play in one (1) or more of
the Regular Season game(s) that he missed during
such Season;
(B) He would have satisfied the Award Eligibility
Criterion set forth in Section 6(a)(1) above if he had
played in every game that he missed due to the
extraordinary circumstances (i.e., assuming that he
would have played twenty (20) minutes in each such
missed game); and
(C) As a result of the extraordinary circumstances, and
taking into account the totality of the circumstances,
including whether the player did not play in other
Regular Season games in which he could have played
during such Season, it would be unjust to exclude the
player from eligibility for the Applicable Generally
Recognized League Honors for such Season.(ii) If the player satisfies the burden and prevails in the
proceeding, the sole remedy shall be that the player is
deemed eligible for the Applicable Generally Recognized
League Honors.
(iii) Extraordinary Circumstances Challenges shall be heard by
an independent expert jointly selected by the NBA and
Players Association (the "Challenge Expert").
(iv) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Section 6(c) shall
apply to the resolution of Extraordinary Circumstances
Challenges. If in connection with such disputes, there is any
conflict between the procedures set forth in this Section 6(c)
and those set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the
procedures set forth in this Section shall control.
(v) An Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge must be brought
by a player in respect of a Season no earlier than 12:00 p.m.
eastern time on the last day of the Regular Season and no
later than 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day following the
last day of the Regular Season.
(vi) A player may initiate an Extraordinary Circumstances
Challenge by serving a written notice thereof on the NBA
and his Team, with a copy of such written notice to be filed
with the Challenge Expert and the Players Association. The
NBA may provide notice thereof to any Team with which
the player was under contract during the Season. The
player's written notice shall be accompanied by a witness list,
relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on
which the player intends to rely in his affirmative case. No
later than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date
on which the Team received written notice of the
Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge, the Team shall
provide to the player, the NBA, and the Players Association
a witness list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary
materials (if any) on which the Team intends to rely in its
affirmative case (if any). Absent a showing of good cause,
neither the player nor the Team may proffer, refer to, or relyon the testimony of any witness, document, or other
evidentiary material in its affirmative case that has not been
identified as required by this Section 6(c)(vi).
(vii) The Challenge Expert shall convene a hearing at the earliest
possible time, but in no event later than two (2) days
following the Expert's receipt of notice of the Extraordinary
Circumstances Challenge. The hearing shall take place by
videoconference and shall last no longer than one (1) day.
The player, the Players Association, the NBA, and any Team
for which the player played during the Season shall have the
right to participate in the hearing.
(viii) The Challenge Expert shall render a decision not later than
the day following the date of the hearing, and the decision
shall be accompanied by a written opinion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Challenge Expert determines that
expedition so requires, he/she shall accompany the decision
with a written summary of the grounds upon which the
decision is based, and a full written opinion may follow
within a reasonable time thereafter. The decision shall
constitute full, final, and complete disposition of the matter.
(x) Should circumstances warrant, each of the deadlines set
forth in this Section 6(c) may be reasonably modified by
agreement of the NBA and Players Association.
Section 7. Playing Rules and Officiating.
(a) Up to four (4) representatives of the Players Association, three (3)

the NBA Competition Committee with respect to issues relating to the NBA
playing rules and officiating.
(b) The Players Association may, on behalf of the players, submit to the
Commissioner monthly reports as to the conduct of referees, including
identifying individual referees by name. The NBA will consider, but is not
required to act, on such reports.(c) The NBA and Players Association shall meet on a quarterly basis to
discuss the relationship and interactions between players and referees,
including any discipline imposed by the NBA on referees for conduct on
the playing court. Each party shall consider in good faith any
recommendations made by the other party at such meetings regarding
referee-player interactions.
(d) Upon a request from the Players Association, representatives of the
NBA Basketball Operations and Referee Operations Departments shall
meet annually with the Players Association and/or players to discuss issues

which Teams shall participate in any Play-In Games shall be made based on
each Team's Regular Season winning percentage.
(d) The Team with the seventh-highest winning percentage in each
Conference shall play the Team with the eighth-highest winning percentage
in its Conference in a Play-In Game (the "Seven-Eight Game"). The winner
of the Seven-Eight Game in each Conference shall participate in the playoffs

(b) Notwithstanding Section 12(a) above, and subject to Sections 12(c)
and 12(d) below, during the term of this Agreement, the Players Association
or an affiliate of the Players Association may invest on behalf of all NBA
players in one or more private investment funds approved by the NBA to
acquire passive, non-voting minority interests in one or more NBA Teams
in accordance with all applicable NBA rules and regulations (each, a "Private
Investment Fund"); provided, however, that any such investments shall be
subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(i) Any such investment must be passive and non-voting and
may not, at any time, exceed five percent (5%) of the
aggregate committed capital of such Private Investment
Fund;(ii) The Players Association shall be subject to the same general
restrictions and rules as applicable to other investors in such
Private Investment Fund (e.g., compliance with applicable
"accredited investor" requirements and minimum
investment thresholds);
(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (ii) above, the Players
Association shall be prohibited from holding or exercising
any active participation rights or roles, and from receiving

its ownership interest in a Private Investment Fund if any of
the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) above cease
to be met.
(c) Any Players Association investment in one or more Private
Investment Funds shall be subject to compliance with all applicable laws,
including but not limited to securities laws and federal labor law. If, at any
point, any Players Association investment or provision of this Section 12
does not comply with applicable laws, then the Players Association shall use
best efforts to, and cause the Private Investment Fund to, modify the terms
of such investment and/or the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify
the terms of this Section 12, in each case, to the extent necessary to fully
comply with law and, if such modifications are not or cannot be negotiated,
then (i) the applicable Players Association investment shall be divested in
full and (ii) the applicable terms of this Section 12 shall be rendered void
and of no further force and effect.
(d) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the NBA
and the Players Association shall form a joint advisory committee (the
"Investment Committee") to study and discuss in good faith any issues
relating to (x) the Players Association's or an affiliate of the Players
Association's investment in Private Investment Funds in accordance with
Sections 12(b) and 12(c) above, as well as (y) a potential CBA modification
pertaining to (i) investment in Private Investment Funds by individual
players investing collectively through a pooled investment vehicle (a"Players Vehicle"), and/or (ii) investment by individual players in NBA
affiliated businesses, in each case taking into account all appropriate legal,
business, and other considerations. Prior to any such investment, the
members of the Investment Committee, either jointly or independently
through each respective party, shall obtain the advice of counsel to the
satisfaction of both the NBA and the Players Association stating that such
investment complies with applicable labor laws, including, without
limitation, Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 (Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947). For clarity, (1) no investment contemplated under
this Section 12(d) shall be permitted unless and until such time as the NBA
and the Players Association confirm to their satisfaction that such
investment would comply with all applicable laws, and (2) no investment by
a Players Vehicle in a Private Investment Fund or investment by players in
NBA affiliated businesses shall be permitted unless and until such time as
the NBA and the Players Association agree upon any new structures and/or
rules required for such investment.
(i) The Investment Committee shall consist of three (3)
representatives appointed by the NBA and three (3)
representatives appointed by the Players Association. At
least one of the members appointed by each of the NBA and
the Players Association must be knowledgeable of private
investment funds and their structures. Unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties, Investment Committee
members may not have an ownership or other financial
interest in any Private Investment Fund.
(ii) The Investment Committee may jointly retain such experts
as it deems necessary in order to conduct its work, which the
parties expect to include investment and legal professionals.
The costs of such experts will be borne equally by the NBA
and the Players Association.
Section 13. Player Ownership in Independent WNBA Teams.
(a) Subject to Section 13(b) below and also subject to WNBA approval
in each case, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XIII,
Section 2(c), an NBA player may invest in a WNBA Team in which no Team
Owner (or family member of a Team Owner) has a direct or indirect
beneficial ownership interest (each such team, an "Independent WNBATeam") on substantially similar terms to other third-party investors, subject
to the following conditions and limitations:
(i) An NBA player's ownership interest in an Independent
WNBA Team may not, at any time, exceed four percent
(4%) of such Independent WNBA Team;
(ii) NBA players may not in the aggregate hold more than an
eight percent (8%) ownership interest in any Independent
WNBA Team;
(iii) An NBA player may hold an ownership interest in only
one (1) Independent WNBA Team at any one time;
(iv) Any NBA player investing in an Independent WNBA Team
shall be subject to WNBA restrictions, rules, and penalties,
as imposed and enforced by the WNBA, applicable to other
WNBA team owners (e.g., relating to tampering, public
comments on collectively bargained matters, and penalties
for misconduct);
(v) Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv) above, an NBA player
shall be prohibited from holding any governance rights or
roles with respect to an Independent WNBA Team in which
he holds an ownership interest or with respect to the
WNBA, including participation on WNBA team or WNBA
league governing bodies;
(vi) NBA players' receipt of information with respect to the
Independent WNBA Team and the WNBA shall be limited
to annual audited team financials and any required tax
information;
(vii) An NBA player may be required by the NBA to divest or
reduce his ownership interest in an Independent WNBA
Team if any of the conditions set forth in subparagraphs
(i)-(vi) above cease to be met; and
(viii) In the event an Independent WNBA Team in which an
NBA player is invested proposes to sell a "controlling
ownership interest" to a Team Owner (or family member ofa Team Owner), any NBA player investor in such
Independent WNBA Team will be required to dispose of its
entire ownership interest in such Independent WNBA
Team, including through the exercise of any tag-along or
drag-along rights applicable to such ownership interest. For
purposes of this Section 13, a "controlling ownership
interest" means a majority of the voting or equity interests
in, or contractual control of, the Independent WNBA Team.
If the Independent WNBA Team's existing governing
agreements do not contain provisions with such rights, then
such agreements shall be amended in connection with an
NBA player's investment to create customary tag-along or
drag-along rights with respect to the player's interests, and
such amendment shall be a condition to such NBA player's
investment. For clarity, in the event an Independent WNBA
Team in which an NBA player is invested proposes to sell
less than a controlling ownership interest to a Team Owner
(or a family member of a Team Owner), such proposed
transaction will not be in compliance with Section 13(a)(1)
above unless such NBA player disposes of his entire
ownership interest in such Independent WNBA Team by
selling to a person or entity that is not a Team Owner (or a
family member of a Team Owner), prior to such proposed
sale.
(b) NBA player investment in Independent WNBA Teams shall be
subject to compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to
securities laws and federal labor law. If, at any point, any player investment
or provision of this Section 13 does not comply with applicable laws, then
the player shall use best efforts to, and cause the Independent WNBA Team
to, modify the terms of such investment and/or the parties will negotiate in
good faith to modify the terms of this Section 13, in each case, to the extent
necessary to fully comply with law and, if such modifications are not or
