If the player satisfies the burden and prevails in the proceeding, the sole remedy shall be that the player is deemed eligible for the Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors. For clarity, neither the foregoing sentence nor anything else in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect the right of the NBA to impose discipline on a Team for conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of the NBA in the event a player prevails in an Award Eligibility Grievance against such Team.</li>

<li>A player may only bring an Award Eligibility Grievance in respect of a Season if being awarded one of the Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors in such Season could impact whether the player is or could become eligible:

<li>Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(a)(i), to enter into a Contract or Extension with a Maximum Annual Salary in the first year covered by the Contract or extended term, as applicable, in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the Salary Cap by virtue of satisfying the Higher Max Criteria;</li>
<li>Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(a)(ii), to enter into a Designated Veteran Player Contract; or</li>
<li>Pursuant to Article II, Section 7(e), to enter into a Designated Veteran Player Extension.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An Award Eligibility Grievance must be brought by a player within two (2) days of the date on which it becomes mathematically impossible for the player to play sixty-five (65) Regular Season games in a Season; provided, however, that any such Grievance must be initiated no later than 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day following the last day of the Regular Season.</li>
<li>A player may initiate an Award Eligibility Grievance against a Team by serving a written notice thereof on the Team, with a copy of such written notice to be filed with the System Arbitrator, the Players Association, and the NBA. Such written notice shall be accompanied by a witness list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on which the player intends to rely in his affirmative case. No later than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date on which the Team received written notice of the Award Eligibility Grievance, the Team shall provide to the player, the NBA, and the Players Association a witness list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on which the Team intends to rely in its affirmative case.

<li>As a result of the extraordinary circumstances, and taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including whether the player did not play in other Regular Season games in which he could have played during such Season, it would be unjust to exclude the player from eligibility for the Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors for such Season.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the player satisfies the burden and prevails in the proceeding, the sole remedy shall be that the player is deemed eligible for the Applicable Generally Recognized League Honors.</li>
<li>Extraordinary Circumstances Challenges shall be heard by an independent expert jointly selected by the NBA and Players Association (the “Challenge Expert”).</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Section 6(c) shall apply to the resolution of Extraordinary Circumstances Challenges.

<li>A player may initiate an Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge by serving a written notice thereof on the NBA and his Team, with a copy of such written notice to be filed with the Challenge Expert and the Players Association. The NBA may provide notice thereof to any Team with which the player was under contract during the Season.

No later than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date on which the Team received written notice of the Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge, the Team shall provide to the player, the NBA, and the Players Association a witness list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary materials (if any) on which the Team intends to rely in its affirmative case (if any). Absent a showing of good cause, neither the player nor the Team may proffer, refer to, or rely on the testimony of any witness, document, or other evidentiary material in its affirmative case that has not been identified as required by this Section 6(c)(vi).</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>An NBA player’s ownership interest in an Independent WNBA Team may not, at any time, exceed four percent (4%) of such Independent WNBA Team;</li>

<li>An NBA player may hold an ownership interest in only one (1) Independent WNBA Team at any one time;</li>
<li>Any NBA player investing in an Independent WNBA Team shall be subject to WNBA restrictions, rules, and penalties, as imposed and enforced by the WNBA, applicable to other WNBA team owners (e.g., relating to tampering, public comments on collectively bargained matters, and penalties for misconduct);</li>
<li>Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv) above, an NBA player shall be prohibited from holding any governance rights or roles with respect to an Independent WNBA Team in which he holds an ownership interest or with respect to the WNBA, including participation on WNBA team or WNBA league governing bodies;</li>

For purposes of this Section 13, a “controlling ownership interest” means a majority of the voting or equity interests in, or contractual control of, the Independent WNBA Team.

For clarity, in the event an Independent WNBA Team in which an NBA player is invested proposes to sell less than a controlling ownership interest to a Team Owner (or a family member of a Team Owner), such proposed transaction will not be in compliance with Section 13(a)(1) above unless such NBA player disposes of his entire ownership interest in such Independent WNBA Team by selling to a person or entity that is not a Team Owner (or a family member of a Team Owner), prior to such proposed sale.</li>

<li>NBA player investment in Independent WNBA Teams shall be subject to compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to securities laws and federal labor law. If, at any point, any player investment or provision of this Section 13 does not comply with applicable laws, then the player shall use best efforts to, and cause the Independent WNBA Team to, modify the terms of such investment and/or the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify the terms of this Section 13, in each case, to the extent necessary to fully comply with law and, if such modifications are not or cannot be negotiated, then (i) the applicable player investment shall be divested in full and (ii) the applicable terms of this Section 13 shall be rendered void and of no further force and effect.</li>

Furthermore, the parties agree and acknowledge that any termination and severance benefits provided to players pursuant to this Agreement (including the provisions of Player Contracts that provide, in certain circumstances, for the continued payment of Salary to a player following the termination of a Player Contract) constitute and/or shall be deemed to constitute a greater right or benefit to the Player pursuant to Section 5(2) of the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (Ontario) and the provisions of Sections 54-66 of such Act do not apply.</li>
<li>The parties acknowledge and agree that a player employed by an NBA Team pursuant to the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, a 10-Day Contract, a Rest-of-Season Contract, or a Two-Way Contract is and/or shall be deemed to be an “employee hired on the basis that his employment is to terminate on the expiry of a definite term or the completion of a specific task” within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Section 2(1) of Ontario Regulation 288/01 under the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000, so as to render inapplicable to NBA players the provisions of Sections 54-62 of such Act.</li>
<li>The parties acknowledge and agree that the severance benefits provided to players pursuant to this Agreement (including the provisions of Player Contracts that provide, in certain circumstances, for the continued payment of Salary to a player following the termination of a Player Contract) constitute and/or shall be deemed to constitute a settlement binding on the player within the meaning of Section 6 of the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000, and/or “an amount paid to an employee for loss of employment under a provision of an employment contract based upon length of employment, length of service or seniority” within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Section 65(8) of the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000, so as to render inapplicable to NBA players the provisions of Sections 63-66 of such Act.</li>
<li>Upon the NBA’s request, the Players Association shall cooperate with the NBA in a reasonable manner in connection with any effort the NBA may make to seek an exemption from any Canadian (federal or provincial) law or regulation affecting the employment relationship that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement between the Players Association and the NBA (or NBA Properties) or between any player and any NBA Team.</li>
<li>All players employed by NBA Teams shall be paid in U.S. dollars, regardless of where such Teams are located.</li>
