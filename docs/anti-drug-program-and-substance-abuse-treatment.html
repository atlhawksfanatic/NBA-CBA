<li>The Medical Director, the SPED Medical Director, and the Independent Expert shall all serve for the duration of this Agreement, unless either the NBA or the Players Association has, by September 1 of any year covered by this Agreement, served written notice of discharge upon the other party and, as appropriate, the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or the Independent Expert. Such notice of discharge shall be effective as of the immediately following September 30; provided, however, that if the parties do not reach agreement by such September 30 as to who shall serve thereafter as the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or the Independent Expert, as the case may be, each party shall, by the immediately following October 15, appoint a person who shall have no relationship to or affiliation with that party. Such persons shall then have until the immediately following December 1 to agree on the appointment of a new Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, and/or Independent Expert.

<li>The NBA and the Players Association shall form a Prohibited Substance Committee, which shall be comprised of one (1) representative from the NBA, one (1) representative from the Players Association, and three (3) individuals jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association who shall be experts in the field of testing and treatment for drugs of abuse and performance-enhancing substances. The members of this Committee shall serve for the duration of the Agreement.</li>
<li>The members of the Prohibited Substances Committee shall meet (either in person or by conference call) at least once each Season and once each off-season (the “Annual Meetings”). The Annual Meetings shall be scheduled by the NBA after consultation with the Players Association. At the Annual Meetings, the Committee shall review the Program’s list of Prohibited Substances, and discuss general anti-doping issues (including, but not limited to, advances in drug testing science and technology, and modifications to relevant anti-doping policies of other sports organizations). The Committee shall also make recommendations to the NBA and the Players Association for changes to the list of Prohibited Substances (including the determination of laboratory analysis cutoff levels).</li>
<li>As of September 1, 2023, and as of each successive September 1, either of the parties to this Agreement may discharge any jointly-selected member of the Prohibited Substances Committee by serving thirty (30) days’ prior notice upon that person and upon the other party to this Agreement. In the case of such discharge, or in the event a Committee member resigns, and if the parties are unable to agree on a replacement Committee member within thirty (30) days, then the parties shall request a list of seven (7) names of potential replacements prepared by the Medical Director and any remaining jointly-selected Committee members, and, within seven (7) days, shall select the necessary replacement by alternately striking names from the list until only one (1) remains.</li>

<li>Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Article XXXIII, all costs of the Program in excess of those covered by the NBA Players Group Health Plan, including the fees and expenses of the Medical Director, the SPED Medical Director, the Independent Expert, and the Prohibited Substances Committee shall be shared equally by the NBA and Players Association. The Players Association’s share shall be paid by the NBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(g) of this Agreement. The fees and expenses incurred by the NBA in conducting testing pursuant to Sections 5, 6, and 16 below shall be borne by the NBA.</li>
<li>Any and all disputes arising under this Article XXXIII shall be resolved in accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15 of this Agreement; provided, however, that in any challenge to a decision, recommendation, or other conduct of the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director, Independent Expert, or Prohibited Substances Committee, or in any challenge to an action or process over which the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director has supervision, the Grievance Arbitrator shall apply an “arbitrary and capricious” standard of review; and provided further that nothing in this Section 2(g) shall limit or otherwise affect Paragraph 19 of the Uniform Player Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party, nor any player or Team, may challenge a determination made by the applicable Program laboratory of whether the estimated or adjusted concentration of a Prohibited Substance that is subject to a confirmatory laboratory analysis level set forth in Exhibit I-6 exceeds the relevant single-point calibrator in a player’s “A” and/or “B” sample.</li>

If the player enters into a Player Contract or an amendment to a Player Contract with a Team, then the NBA shall promptly inform the Team of the player’s positive test and/or potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification and notice obligation pursuant to this Section 3(h)(i). Within six (6) business days of being so informed by the NBA, the Team may request that the NBA render the player’s Contract (or amendment, as the case may be) null and void if the Team believes that the player failed to provide the Team with written notice pursuant to this Section 3(h). If a Team makes such a request, and the NBA then determines that the player failed to provide the Team with such written notice, the player’s Contract (or amendment, as the case may be) shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect.</li>

<li>If, while the player is subject to a potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification pursuant to Section 3(h)(1) or (2) above, the player has been placed on waivers and a Team claims the rights to the player, prior to notifying a Team that it has acquired such rights, the NBA shall provide written notice of the positive result and/or potential suspension or dismissal and disqualification to such Team. Upon receiving such notice, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Team shall have the right to withdraw its waiver claim pursuant to a process established by the NBA.</li>

<li>Testing conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII, whether by the NBA, the Medical Director, or the SPED Medical Director, shall be conducted in compliance with scientifically accepted analytical techniques. Such testing shall also comply with Section 4(b) below, the collection procedures described in Exhibit I-3 (for urine collections) and Exhibit I-4 (for blood collections) to this Agreement, and such additional procedures and protocols as may be established by the NBA (after consultation with the Players Association) or the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the NBA and the Players Association). The NBA and the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the Players Association), are authorized to retain such consultants and support services as are necessary and appropriate to administer and conduct such testing.</li>
<li>If a player is selected for random drug testing pursuant to Section 6 below on a day he is scheduled to play a game, the following additional procedures will apply: (i) any blood testing must occur after the game; and (ii) for urine testing of a player on the visiting Team scheduled at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the shoot-around for that Team commences, and for any tests that are not completed by the time the visiting Team bus is scheduled to leave the arena or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the Team will provide alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and accompanies him or them back to the Team’s hotel.</li>
<li>All tests conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII shall be analyzed by laboratories selected by the NBA and the Players Association, and certified by the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).</li>
<li>Any test conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII will be considered “positive” for a Prohibited Substance under the following circumstances:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>If the test is for a SPED or Diuretic, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-6.</li>
<li>If a player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only); provided, however, that the NBA will use its best efforts (A) to have the drug testing collectors immediately notify the NBA when any player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, and (B) to provide such information to the Players Association as soon as possible thereafter; and provided, further, that (C) following any player’s refusal to submit to a test or failure to cooperate fully with the testing process, the drug testing collector shall wait ninety (90) minutes at the collection site, and (D) if the player submits to the test and cooperates fully with the testing process within such additional time, then his earlier refusal or failure to cooperate shall be excused and the test shall not be deemed positive under this Section 4(d).</li>
<li>If the player fails to submit to a scheduled test, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only).</li>
<li>If the player attempts to substitute, dilute, or adulterate a specimen sample or in any other manner alter a test result (other than by testing positive for a Diuretic).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of any positive test conducted by the NBA, and shall thereafter notify the player. The Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable) shall promptly notify the player of any positive test conducted by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable); provided, however, that if the positive test will result in a penalty to be imposed on the player, the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) shall notify the NBA and the Players Association of the positive test result and the NBA shall thereafter notify the player of such result and such penalty.</li>
<li>Upon notifying the Players Association of any positive test or atypical finding of an “A” sample, the NBA shall direct the testing of the split or “B” sample of the player’s specimen. The test of the “B” sample will be performed at a laboratory other than the laboratory that performed the test of the original or “A” sample. Any such test shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 4. The NBA will notify the Players Association of the result of the test of the player’s “B” sample and, if the result is positive, the Players Association may, within five (5) business days of the date of such notification, direct the NBA to request documentation package(s) for the player’s “A” sample and “B” sample from the applicable Program laboratory. Within ten (10) business days of receiving a documentation package pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Players Association may hold a conference call among the NBA, the Players Association, and the applicable Program laboratory to request clarification of any information in such documentation package; provided, however, if it is impracticable to hold such conference call within ten (10) business days of receiving a documentation package, then the Players Association may instead seek clarification of any information in the documentation package via an email to the applicable Program laboratory (with the NBA copied), which email must be sent within ten (10) business days of receiving a respective documentation package.</li>
<li>Any positive test pursuant to Section 4(d)(i) above shall be reviewed by the Medical Director. Any positive test pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii) above shall be reviewed by the SPED Medical Director. If the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) determines, in his or her professional judgment, that there is a valid alternative medical explanation for such positive test result, then the test shall be deemed negative.</li>
<li>If the test result for any player is reported by the laboratory as “invalid” or “endogenous steroids abnormally low,” the NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association, and shall thereafter notify the player. In the event of such a test result, the player shall be required to submit to another test on a date determined by the NBA that is not more than thirty (30) days after the date of the original test (the “Re-Test”). If the Re-Test results in (i) a positive test for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine or a positive test under Section 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) below; (ii) a positive test for a synthetic cannabinoid, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 10 below; (iii) a positive test for a SPED or Benzodiazepine, the player shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below; or (iv) a positive test for a Diuretic, the player shall be deemed to have tested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 below. The original test will not be counted towards the number of tests to be administered to that player for that Season under Section 6 (Random Testing) below.</li>
<li>For clarity, if the test result for any player reports a SPED or Diuretic at a detectable level below the confirmatory laboratory analysis levels set forth in Exhibit I-6 (and, for clenbuterol, above 0.2 ng/ml but below 1 ng/ml), the result shall be treated as an atypical finding under the Program and, as a result, the player shall be subject to testing for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing on the date the NBA is notified by the applicable Program laboratory of the atypical finding.

<li>In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association has information that gives it reasonable cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, including information that a First-Year Player may have been engaged in such conduct during the period beginning three (3) months prior to his entry into the NBA, such party shall request a conference with the other party and the Independent Expert, which shall be held within twenty-four (24) hours or as soon thereafter as the Expert is available. Upon hearing the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player.</li>
<li>In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent Expert shall use his or her independent judgment based upon his or her experience in substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources, and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.</li>
<li>Immediately upon the Independent Expert’s issuance of an Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for synthetic cannabinoids (if the authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s use, possession, or distribution of synthetic cannabinoids), or for SPEDs (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.</li>

If the player tests positive for a SPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the Authorization for Testing was issued.</li>
<li>In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, has engaged in a felony involving the distribution of marijuana, or has received treatment for use of a Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth in Sections 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a Prohibited Substance, has engaged in a felony involving the distribution of marijuana, or has received treatment other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) below, notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed a SPED, Benzodiazepine, Diuretic, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 below, as the case may be.</li>

The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player’s dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player’s conduct since his dismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.</li>

For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above in connection with a Drug of Abuse, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Drug of Abuse or synthetic cannabinoid within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her professional judgment, for marijuana and/or alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.

<li>A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player’s Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(a)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player’s new Contract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player’s new Contract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the Player’s Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new Contract, then the player’s Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player’s Rookie Scale Contract.</li>
