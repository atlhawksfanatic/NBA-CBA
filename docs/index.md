# Preface {-}

*If you are only interested in a pdf or epub of the CBA, then please click on the download icon at the top left (it is next to the "A") and select the format you wish to download.*

This is the 2023 NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) converted to markdown and disseminated in the format you are currently viewing this as.

The original version of the 2023 CBA can be found on my Github website [atlhawksfanatic.github.io](https://atlhawksfanatic.github.io/) ([pdf found here](https://github.com/atlhawksfanatic/atlhawksfanatic.github.io/raw/master/research/CBA/2023-NBA-NBPA-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf)) as a way to cross-reference any potential discrepancies.

The original CBA was converted to a text file with [pdftools](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools), then broken up by Article and Exhibit through regular expressions into .Rmd files. Those .Rmd files serves as the basis for this bookdown site. 

The purpose of this project is three-fold:

1. to historically document collective bargaining agreements of the NBA;
2. to provide easier navigation of the CBA through a structured format of each Article and Section; and
3. for me to better understand the CBA through this exercise.

I do not own any rights to the CBA and am simply redistributing it in a different format. This is not the official version of the CBA and I am not responsible for any errors that might be present in this document. If you believe you have found an error, please let me know and I will correct it.
