<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Player Pension Benefits.</h2>
<p>Subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the NBA shall provide the following pension benefits to NBA players and former NBA players in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the National Basketball Association Players’ Pension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 2014, and as amended from time to time and as to be modified as set forth herein (the “Pension Plan”). (All capitalized terms used in this Section 1 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Pension Plan.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><u><strong>Benefits.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Current Benefit. As of the effective date of this Agreement, the monthly amount per Year of Credited Service payable as a Normal Retirement Pension (the “Monthly Benefit”) is $572.13.</li>
<li>Benefit Increases. Effective for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2018, and for each subsequent Plan Year during the term of this Agreement:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The Monthly Benefit shall be adjusted (the Monthly Benefit following any such adjustment, the “New Monthly Benefit”) such that, subject to Section 1(a)(4) below, the Normal Retirement Pension shall equal the maximum benefit amount permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (and the regulations issued thereunder), as in effect as of the effective date of this Agreement, as such maximum benefit amount may be adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of the Code. Effective for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2018, and for each subsequent Plan Year during the term of this Agreement, the amount of the New Monthly Benefit shall be determined using the modified actuarial reduction factors to be specified in the Pension Plan by amendment effective for the Plan Year beginning February 2, 2018.</li>
<li>Any increase in the Normal Retirement Pension payable on or after the date of this Agreement: (A) shall apply only to those players and beneficiaries (x) who have not yet received or begun to receive a benefit under the Pension Plan as of the first day of the month following the beginning of the Plan Year to which the increase relates (the “New Benefit Increase Commencement Date”) or (y) who are receiving monthly benefits under the Pension Plan as of the New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; (B) shall be effective as of the New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; (C) shall apply only to any benefit payment(s) to be made on or after the applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date; and (D) shall not require the recalculation of any benefit payment(s) made prior to the applicable New Benefit Increase Commencement Date.</li>
<li>The Pension Plan shall provide that the amount of the Normal Retirement Pension that exceeds the Fixed Part A Benefit (defined below) (other than any death benefits payable to a beneficiary pursuant to Article VII of the Pension Plan) shall not be payable in the form of a Lump Sum Option. The “Fixed Part A Benefit” shall mean that portion of the Normal Retirement Pension equal to the amount described in Section 1.21 of the Pension Plan as of the effective date of this Agreement; provided, however, that no adjustments for increases in the cost-of-living that may go into effect after the effective date of this Agreement shall be taken into account for purposes of calculating the Fixed Part A Benefit.</li>
<li>The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide that a player shall not be considered to be on the Roster for a Regular Season solely because he was under a 10-Day Contract or Two-Way Contract as of February 2nd of such Regular Season.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pre-1965 Players and Pre-1965 Retirees. Effective for the Plan Year commencing February 2, 2018, and for each subsequent Plan Year during the term of this Agreement:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide that the Normal Retirement Benefit payable to a Pre-1965 Player and the “A portion” of the Retirement Benefit payable to a Pre-1965 Retiree shall be $400 per month for each Year of Pre-1965 Credited Service or Year of Eligible Pre-1965 Retiree Service, respectively (the “2017-18 Pre-1965 Benefit Increase”).</li>
<li>Any pension benefits that are unable to be paid to Pre- 1965 Players and Pre-1965 Retirees because of the benefit limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code shall be paid to such Pre-1965 Players and Pre-1965 Retirees pursuant to the National Basketball Association Excess Benefit Plan for Pre-1965 Players (the “Pre-1965 Players Excess Benefit Plan”).</li>
<li>The increase provided by this Section 1(a)(3) shall: (A) apply only to those Pre-1965 Players, Pre-1965 Retirees or their beneficiaries who are receiving monthly pension benefits as of March 1, 2018; (B) apply only with respect to any pension benefit payment(s) made on or after March 1, 2018; and (C) not require the recalculation of any pension benefit payment(s) made prior to March 1, 2018.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Limitations on Benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Neither: (A) the pension benefits accrued or payable to any player or beneficiary for a Plan Year nor (B) the New Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder) as in effect for that Plan Year (as adjusted in accordance with the actuarial factors specified in the Pension Plan and as in effect on the date that the benefit accrues or commences (or is paid) or for the Plan Year for which the New Monthly Benefit is determined), as such maximum benefit amount may be adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner provided under Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.</li>
<li>Neither the pension benefits accrued nor payable to any player or beneficiary for a Plan Year shall exceed the maximum benefit amount permitted under the Code (and the regulations issued thereunder), as in effect as of the effective date of this Agreement, as adjusted in accordance with the actuarial factors specified in the Pension Plan, and as may be adjusted for future increases in the cost-of-living in the manner prescribed by Section 415(d)(2) of the Code.</li>
<li>If all or any portion of the actuarially-determined annual contributions to be made to the Pension Plan would not be fully deductible under the Code when paid to the Pension Plan, the New Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount which would result in all of such contributions being fully-deductible when paid. In the event that any such contribution or portion thereof is not fully deductible when paid, the NBA and the Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs of any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the amount by which the New Monthly Benefit is reduced pursuant to this Section 1(a)(4)(iii). If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Administration.</strong></u> Effective as of the effective date of this Agreement, the NBA and the Players Association shall cause to be amended the Pension Plan and the Agreement of Trust, by and among the NBA Teams and certain individual Trustees, dated January 17, 1997 (the “Pension Trust Agreement”) to provide that the Pension Plan shall be maintained and operated as described in this Section 1(b).
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Subject to Section 1(b)(5), which is expressly designed to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Pension Plan shall be jointly operated and administered by the NBA and Players Association in accordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and the provisions of the Pension Trust Agreement and the Pension Plan. The Pension Trust Agreement shall provide for a six (6)-member Board of Trustees (the “Pension Plan Trustees”), three (3) of whom are to be appointed by the NBA and three (3) of whom are to be appointed by the Players Association; provided, however, that the daily operations of the Pension Plan shall be delegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as selected by the Pension Plan Trustees in their sole discretion. In the exercise of its responsibilities, each such independent third-party administrator shall be required to comply with ERISA and all other applicable laws and to act in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the Pension Trust Agreement and the Pension Plan.</li>
<li>It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that: (i) the Pension Plan shall continue to constitute a collectively-bargained multiemployer defined benefit pension plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; and (ii) the Pension Plan’s corresponding Trust is exempt from taxation under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code.</li>
<li>Subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), including, without limitation, ERISA’s requirements applicable to pension plan fiduciaries, or other applicable law, the Pension Plan Trustees will give due consideration to past practice with regard to administrative determinations and interpretations.</li>
<li>An arbitration provision will be added to the Pension Trust Agreement substantially in the form as follows: In the event that the Trustees cannot decide any question of the administration (within the meaning of Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended) of the Pension Plan or Trust because of a tie vote or lack of a quorum at two (2) successive meetings of the Trustees, then the Trustees shall, upon written application of the NBA Trustees or the Players Association Trustees, submit such dispute to an impartial umpire in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s Impartial Umpire Rules for Arbitration of Impasses Between Trustees of Joint Employee Benefit Trust Funds. The decision of said umpire shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Trustees and all persons concerned. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the fee of the impartial umpire and the American Arbitration Association, together with such other costs and expenses as may be authorized by the Trustees, shall be proper charges against the Trust, which the Trustees are authorized to pay. The impartial umpire in his or her decision shall be bound by the provisions of the Pension Plan, the Pension Trust Agreement and the charters, rules, policies and procedures put in place by past or current Pension Plan fiduciaries (the “Governing Documents”). The impartial umpire shall have no power or authority to add to or subtract from the Governing Documents or to change, modify or amend the provisions of the Governing Documents or the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NBA and the Players Association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Trustees appointed by the NBA nor the Trustees appointed by the Players Association may compel arbitration regarding a claim for benefits that would be time-barred under the Pension Plan or applicable law.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) the Players Association shall forfeit its right to appoint Pension Plan Trustees; (ii) the appointment and Trusteeship of the then-current Pension Plan Trustees who had been appointed by the Players Association shall automatically end; and (iii) sponsorship, administration and operation of the Pension Plan shall automatically revert back to the NBA. The Pension Plan shall again become jointly operated and administered by the NBA and Players Association immediately upon their entering into a new collective bargaining agreement, and the provisions of this Section 1(b) shall be incorporated into such new agreement. Furthermore, in the event that the sponsorship and administration has reverted back to the NBA under this paragraph, and subject to ERISA, including, without limitation, ERISA’s requirements applicable to pension plan fiduciaries, the Trustees who are appointed by the NBA will continue to give due consideration to past practice, including past practice established during the period of joint administration by the NBA and Players Association, with regard to administrative determinations and interpretations.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Contributions/Funding.</strong></u> The NBA and Players Association acknowledge and agree that the Teams shall continue at all times to contribute to the Plan at least the amount necessary to meet the Pension Plan’s statutory minimum funding requirements under Section 412, Section 431 and, if applicable, Section 432 of the Code, or any other applicable law (the “Minimum Funding Standards”) for such Plan Year, as determined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. For any period during the term of this Agreement during which a new “funding improvement plan” (a “FIP”) is required to be adopted by the Pension Plan under the Minimum Funding Standards, the funding benchmark for such FIP shall equal the funding benchmark required by the Minimum Funding Standards. The Teams may, in the sole discretion of the NBA, contribute to the Pension Plan more than the amount necessary to meet the Minimum Funding Standards; provided, however, that any such additional contribution amount shall not be greater than the contribution amount determined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan in accordance with the Pension Plan’s historical scheduled contribution methodology. All contributions shall be conditioned on their being fully deductible by the Teams when paid.</li>
<li><u><strong>Players Employed by Toronto.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Partnership (or any successor thereto) (“Toronto”) or by an NBA Team located in any country other than the United States shall receive pension benefits of comparable value. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d)(2), players employed by Toronto (“Toronto Players”) shall continue to receive such benefits by means of the Pension Plan and a separate pension plan maintained by Toronto (the “Toronto Plan”); provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate) in the Pension Plan for any period of time during which the player is both a resident of Canada for income tax purposes and a Toronto Player (a “Canadian Resident”) but shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below.</li>
<li>If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan would, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to Canadian provincial pension legislation and/or Canadian federal income tax laws (to the extent that the application of such laws would result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the NBA Teams or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto Plan’s failure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the Code or registered under Canadian provincial pension legislation or Canadian federal tax laws, then any obligation to establish, maintain or make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect of Toronto Players and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. Any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the Pension Plan and the Toronto Plan. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status.</strong></u> Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any of the amendments or benefit increases to be provided under the Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 1, would result in the Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the Pension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in connection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to continue to provide for the accrual of additional benefits under the Pension Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs of any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the benefit described in this Section 1, commencing on the date of termination. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.</li>
<li><u><strong>Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount.</strong></u> The following amounts shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below:

<li>Each Two-Way Player who is on the Active List, Inactive List or Two-Way List of any Team during a Regular Season shall be included as an Eligible Player subject to the terms and conditions of the 401(k) Plan. Unless a Two-Way Player who is an Eligible Player affirmatively elects a different Salary Deferral Contribution (including, without limitation, no Salary Deferral Contribution) for a Season, such player’s Compensation shall be automatically reduced for the payroll periods occurring between the beginning of the Regular Season in which the Two-Way Player is on a Roster and the June 30 immediately following the end of such Regular Season in substantially equal amounts which, when summed together, equal the maximum deferral amount permitted under Section 402(g) of the Code in effect for such Season. Such amounts shall be deposited to the 401(k) Plan as Salary Deferral Contributions.</li>
<li>Except as may be limited below, each Two-Way Player who is an Eligible Player shall be entitled to receive a “Two-Way Matching Contribution” equal to the lesser of: (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of his Salary Deferral Contributions; and (ii) one percent (1%) of his Compensation; provided, however, that if the Two-Way Player is signed or converted to a Standard NBA Contract during a Salary Cap Year and meets the requirements under the 401(k) Plan to be an Eligible Player without regard to the changes to the 401(k) Plan that are contemplated by this Section 2(b), then his Two-Way Matching Contribution in respect of his Salary Deferral Contributions made during such Salary Cap Year shall not be determined pursuant to this Section 2(b) but shall instead be determined pursuant to Section 2(a) above.</li>

<li>Matching Contributions, Two-Way Matching Contributions, Salary Deferral Contributions and After Tax Contributions shall at all times be subject to all applicable limitations under the Code, including, without limitation, the maximum limitation on contributions under Code Section 415, the maximum limitation on compensation under Code Section 401(a)(17), and the maximum limitation on 401(k) deferrals under Code Section 402(g).</li>
<li>The total amount of the Salary Deferral Contributions, Matching Contributions and Two-Way Matching Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan shall be limited to an amount that, taking into account only Compensation paid to current players by the Teams, would result in all of such Salary Deferral Contributions, Matching Contributions and Two-Way Matching Contributions being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the 401(k) Plan. If, for any reason, all or a portion of the Salary Deferral Contributions, Matching Contributions and/or Two-Way Matching Contributions to be made to the 401(k) Plan will not, when paid to the 401(k) Plan, be fully deductible under the Code, the NBA and the Players Association agree that the contributions shall be reduced to result in all such contributions being fully deductible when paid.</li>

If the NBA and the Players Association should determine that the 401(k) Plan cannot continue to be provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. The costs of any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the 401(k) Plan with respect to the Matching Contributions for the Toronto Players. The cost to Toronto of providing for any such alternative arrangement: (1) shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and (2) shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below.

The cost of any such alternative arrangement shall: (A) be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided by Section 8 below, and (B) be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(2) below. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right: (x) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of 401(k) benefits to the players; (y) to lockout; or (z) to strike.</li>

In addition, the NBA and the Players Association agree to meet and confer to discuss the establishment of a long-term care insurance benefit; provided, however, that, neither party shall have any obligation to establish a long-term care insurance benefit.

<li>For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 3(b) shall prevent the Education Trust (defined below) from engaging or hiring an academic advisor or career counselor to assist with player outreach and similar functions with respect to the tuition reimbursement and career transition program set forth in Section 3(a)(7).</li>

<li><u><strong>Players Employed by Toronto.</strong></u> The terms of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan shall permit participation by Toronto Players on the same basis as players who are not Toronto Players; provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the HRA Benefit for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below. If the NBA and the Players Association determine that the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan cannot provide one or more of the benefits described in Section 3(a) to Toronto Players (1) that are substantially equivalent to the benefits provided to players employed by Teams located in the United States or (2) on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal income tax laws, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. The annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection with any such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to fund the applicable benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) for such Toronto Player. The cost to Toronto of funding an alternative arrangement to the HRA Benefit shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, and shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(7) below. The cost to Toronto of funding any alternative arrangement(s) to any of the benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to any alternative arrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or to be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.</li>
<li><u><strong>Deductibility of Contributions/Regulatory Changes.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid to the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust (or directly to an insurance carrier for a benefit provided under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan). If any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to provide the benefit (or portion of the benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan to which the contribution relates) and to make further contributions to provide the benefit (or portion of the benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan to which the contribution relates) shall immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3) shall apply.</li>
<li>In the event that any benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan is no longer permissible or available due to applicable laws (a “Regulatory Change”), the obligation to provide the benefit shall immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3) shall apply.</li>
<li>Any termination of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan or a benefit under such plan pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement, or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan (or the applicable benefit provided or to be provided); (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of any termination pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan or a benefit under such plan, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to alternative arrangement(s) to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players; provided, however, that any such alternative arrangement(s) shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to an alternative arrangement to the Retiree Medical Plan, the terms and conditions set forth in Section 3(a)(6). The annual cost incurred by the NBA Teams in connection with any such alternative arrangement(s) (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred in providing the relevant benefit(s) under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan commencing on the date of termination. Any such alternative arrangement(s) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan, be funded by such monies as may then remain in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and, if the monies remaining in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such alternative arrangement(s) shall be funded by the NBA Teams. Any such alternative arrangement(s) shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid.

The costs of funding any alternative arrangement(s) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> The Post-Career Income Plan.</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by the Code and applicable law, the NBA shall provide the following post-career income benefits to NBA players and former NBA players in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the National Basketball Association Players’ Qualified Post-Career Income Plan, as restated effective November 1, 2012, and as amended from time to time (the “Qualified Plan”) and the National Basketball Association Players’ Non-Qualified Post-Career Income Plan, as restated effective February 15, 2015, and as amended from time to time (the “Non-Qualified Plan,” and, when referenced collectively with the Qualified Plan, the “Post-Career Income Plan”). (All capitalized terms used in this Section 4 not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Post-Career Income Plan.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><u><strong>Current Benefits.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Effective for the Contribution Year (defined below) commencing November 1, 2017, and for each subsequent Contribution Year during the term of this Agreement, the Post-Career Income Plan shall continue to provide for (i) a Team contribution to the Post-Career Income Plan for Eligible Players to be used to purchase Post-Career Annuities (the “Team Contribution”) and (ii) elective Player Contributions made by Qualifying Players to the Non-Qualified Plan to be used to purchase Post-Career Annuities on such players’ behalf; provided, however, that the Post-Career Income Plan shall be amended, effective as of the 2017-18 Contribution Year, to provide that that a player shall not be considered to be on a Roster for a Contribution Year solely because he was under a 10-Day Contract or Two-Way Contract as of February 2nd of the Regular Season ending within such Contribution Year. The Team Contribution for each Eligible Player for each Contribution Year shall equal (A) the Additional Benefit Amount (defined below) divided by the total number of Eligible Players for such Contribution Year (including, for this purpose only, any Canadian Resident who but for the fact that he is a Canadian Resident would otherwise be an Eligible Player) (such quotient, an Eligible Player’s “Allocated Share”), less (B) tax withholding (solely with respect to contributions made to the Non-Qualified Plan) in the manner described in Section 3.3 of the Non-Qualified Plan (“Tax Withholding”). For each Contribution Year, a portion of a player’s Allocated Share shall be contributed to the Qualified Plan on behalf of such player pursuant to the terms and conditions described in the Qualified Plan, and a portion to the Non-Qualified Plan pursuant to the terms and conditions described in the Non-Qualified Plan. For purposes of this Section 4, a “Contribution Year” means each November 1 through October 31 in respect of which a Team Funding Pool (defined below) is provided under this Section 4.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4(a) to the contrary, and subject to the requirements of the Code and IRS rules and regulations, if the Board of Trustees of the Post-Career Income Plan (the “PCIP Trustees”) determines, after Post-Career Annuities have been purchased for Eligible Players for a Contribution Year, that a present or former player should have received an Allocated Share for such Contribution Year but did not receive an Allocated Share, such present or former player shall be entitled to an Allocated Share equal to the amount of the Allocated Share made to the other Eligible Players for such Contribution Year, which shall be used to purchase one or more Post-Career Annuities in the same manner and on the same terms as the other Eligible Players for such Contribution Year. Unless practicable and otherwise agreed to by the PCIP Trustees, the cost of such Allocated Share shall not require a retroactive reduction in the Allocated Share and Post-Career Annuities of the other Eligible Players for such Contribution Year but rather shall be paid from the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season is insufficient, future Seasons). In addition, the cost of any additional fees or expenses charged by the Insurer for the purchase of such Post-Career Annuity (or for the purchase of any other Post-Career Annuity(ies) under the Plan on a retroactive basis) shall also be paid from the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season is insufficient, future Seasons).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Deductibility of Team Contributions/Regulatory Changes.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Post-Career Income Plan shall be structured and maintained in a manner that will result in the Team Funding Pool being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian laws) when used toward Team Contributions contributed to the Post-Career Income Plan. In the event that a Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for its portion of the Team Funding Pool, then the Team shall be returned such disallowed deduction from the Post-Career Income Plan; provided, however, that, if such portion may not be returned to the Team under the terms of the Plan or the applicable Group Annuity Contract or applicable law, then such Team shall instead be reimbursed for the lost tax benefit resulting from the disallowance of the deduction from the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season (or, to the extent the Additional Benefit Amount for the next Season is insufficient, future Seasons) following the date such Team submits satisfactory documentation of the disallowance to the PCIP Trustees.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, if any event or occurrence, including, without limitation, (i) any change oramendment made to the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder, (ii) any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder, (iii) any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA or (iv) any provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 4(b), would result in the Teams being disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for contributions made to the Post-Career Income Plan, then any obligation to maintain the Post-Career Income Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the NBA, terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, if any event or occurrence, including, without limitation, (i) any change or amendment made to the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued thereunder, (ii) any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder, (iii) any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations), or rulings or formal guidance issued by the IRS under the Code or ERISA or (iv) any provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 4, would result in the Qualified Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the Qualified Plan in order to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in connection with the provision of benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions in respect of the Qualified Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.</li>
<li>If the Taxable Allocated Share attributable to Eligible Players would be subject to a federal income tax rate higher than the rate that would apply if the Taxable Allocated Share were paid as Base Compensation, then any obligation to maintain the Post-Career Income Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the Players Association, terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.</li>
<li>In the event of a termination described in Sections 4(b)(2)-(4), the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The annual cost to the Teams of any such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall be substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the Post-Career Income Plan on the date of termination. The cost of funding of any such alternative arrangement shall be as set forth in Section 4(d)(1). If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Players Employed by Toronto.</strong></u> The terms of the Post-Career Income Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that a player shall not be eligible to participate in the Post-Career Income Plan for the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but shall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7 below. If the NBA and the Players Association should determine that the Post-Career Income Plan cannot continue to be provided to Toronto Players on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal income tax laws or that either the Qualified Plan or the Non-Qualified Plan would become subject to Ontario’s Pension Benefits Act, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players. The cost of any such alternative arrangement to be provided in any Contribution Year shall come from such year’s Team Funding Pool and shall equal an Eligible Player’s Allocated Share for such Contribution Year as reduced by all federal, state, local, payroll or other tax obligations of any kind (including, where applicable, Canadian tax) applicable to such player as Toronto, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems necessary. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike.</li>
<li><u><strong>Funding.</strong></u>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each Season, except as provided below, one percent (1%) of BRI for such Season (the “Additional Benefit Amount”) shall be used to fund the Team Funding Pool (or the alternative arrangement referenced in Section 4(b)(5) and 4(c)); provided, however, that the Additional Benefit Amount for a Season shall be subject to reduction or elimination pursuant to Article VII, Section 12(b)(1). In no event shall the Additional Benefit Amount be used for any purpose other than as set forth in the immediately foregoing sentence. For purposes of all calculations called for under this Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation, for purposes of (i) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or Interim Escrow Audit Report, and (ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits), the amount to be included with respect to the Additional Benefit Amount shall be the full Additional Benefit Amount specified in this Section 4(d) and not the reduced Additional Benefit Amount provided for under Article VII, Section 12(b)(1).</li>
<li>For each Contribution Year, all or a portion of the Additional Benefit Amount as determined under Section 4(d)(1) (the “Team Funding Pool”) shall be used to fund the Post-Career Income Plan in the manner described below. Each Team shall fund its portion of the Team Funding Pool for a Contribution Year in an amount equal to the Team Funding Pool for such Contribution Year divided by the number of all Teams in the NBA as of the beginning of such Contribution Year.</li>
<li>Each Team shall pay its respective portion of the Team Funding Pool to the NBA, and the NBA, as the agent of the Teams, shall remit such pool, less Tax Withholding, into the Post-Career Income Plan each November following the Contribution Year to which it relates or, if later, within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the completion of the Audit Report covering the November 1 of such Contribution Year.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u><strong>Amounts to be Applied Against New Benefit Amount.</strong></u> All costs, including, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees and other administrative services provided to the Post-Career Income Plan, but excluding the cost of contributions made to the Post-Career Income Plan, incurred on or after the date of this Agreement in connection with the operation and administration of the Post-Career Income Plan (or any alternative arrangement pursuant to Section 4(b)(5) and 4(c)) shall be (i) paid by the Teams; (ii) applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for in Section 8 below; and (iii) limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(6) below.</li>

<li>Except as set forth below in this Section 5, as of the effective date of this Agreement, and continuing until the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the National Basketball Players Association/National Basketball Association Labor-Management Cooperation and Education Trust (the “Education Trust”) shall continue to be jointly operated and administered by the NBA and the Players Association in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust Establishing the National Basketball Players Association/National Basketball Association Labor-Management Cooperation and Education Trust (the “Education Trust Agreement”). It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that, at all times, the Education Trust shall comply with the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and shall qualify as an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(3) of the Code.</li>
<li>The Education Trust shall continue to be operated and administered for the purpose of establishing and providing (i) health education programs and (ii) education and career counseling programs designed to assist the NBA, NBA Teams and NBA players in solving problems of mutual concern not susceptible to resolution within the collective bargaining process and to enhance the involvement of NBA players in making decisions that affect their working lives. The NBA and the Players Association agree to meet and confer to discuss the Education Trust establishing a modified financial education program, subject to the modified financial education program being structured to qualify as a permitted activity of an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5) of the Code; provided, however, that neither party shall have any obligation to establish a modified financial education program. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that an agreed-upon modified financial education program cannot be structured to qualify as a permitted activity of an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(c)(5) of the Code, the NBA and Players Association agree to meet and confer regarding the establishment of such program through a different vehicle than the Education Trust. The specific benefits to be provided under any financial education program shall be (A) subject to the agreement of the NBA and the Players Association and (B) governed by a definitive written arrangement implementing such program.</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Except as provided in Section 5(c)(2) below, the costs of funding the Education Trust and the costs attributable to the operation and administration of the Education Trust, including, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees incurred in connection with the administration of the Education Trust, shall be (i) paid by the Teams; (ii) applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below; and (iii) limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below. Payment of the amount necessary to fund the Education Trust in respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30) days following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year. The NBA and Players Association agree that, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 5, the amount to be paid by the Teams to fund the education and career counseling programs to be operated and administered by the Education Trust for the 2017-18 Salary Cap Year shall be no greater than $1,507,608 and such maximum funding amount shall be increased by five percent (5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year.</li>
<li>The costs of funding the health education programs to be operated and administered by the Education Trust (or any programs that, pursuant to Section 5(f) below, are substituted for the health education programs) shall be paid by the Teams. Payment of the amount necessary to fund such programs in respect of each Salary Cap Year shall be made within thirty (30) days following the completion of the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.

</ol></li>
<li>The Education Trust shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid. If any Team is disallowed a deduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and unless the NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to maintain the Education Trust and to make further contributions to the Education Trust shall immediately terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement, and shall not create any right (1) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of education programs provided or to be provided by the Education Trust; (2) to lockout; or (3) to strike.</li>
<li>In the event of any termination pursuant to Section 5(d) above, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement designed to provide the programs described in the Education Trust Agreement. Such alternative arrangement shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be funded by such monies as may then remain in the Education Trust and, if the monies remaining in the Education Trust may not lawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such alternative arrangement shall be funded, by the NBA Teams; provided, however, that the annual cost incurred by the Teams in connection with such alternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred to fund the Education Trust commencing on the date of termination. Any such alternative arrangement shall be operated and administered in a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income tax laws) when paid; and, if funded by the Teams (and not out of existing monies remaining in the Education Trust), the costs of funding any alternative to the Education Trust shall be applied against the New Benefit Amount provided for by Section 8 below, shall be limited to the portion of the New Benefit Amount, if any, that is available for this purpose pursuant to Section 8(b)(5) below, and shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

<li>Upon written notice delivered to the NBA at least six (6) months prior to the commencement of any Salary Cap Year, the Players Association may elect to terminate the programs currently provided by the Education Trust and substitute alternative programs; provided, however, that the NBA consents to such substitution, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that any new programs shall comply with the provisions of Section 302(c)(9) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and shall qualify as a permitted activity of an exempt organization under Section 501(c)(5) of the Code.</li>

If the New Benefit Amount is insufficient for these purposes, the shortfall, over as short a period of time as is reasonably possible, shall be offset against: (i) the New Benefit Amount for the next Salary Cap Year; and/or (ii) the NBA’s obligation to provide Benefits (other than Benefits funded via the New Benefit Amount) under this Article IV.
