<p>In their individual contract negotiations, a player and a Team may amend the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, but only in the following respects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Compensation to be paid or amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract for rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such Contract.</p></li>
<li><p>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses, and the payment date for each such bonus, to be paid as a result of: (i) the player’s execution of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a “signing bonus”); (ii) the player’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his performance as a player or the Team’s performance during a particular NBA Season, subject to the limitations imposed by Paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform Player Contract and Section 12(d) below; or (iii) the player’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his physical condition or academic achievement (e.g., earning a college degree or completion of a certified leadership training program), including the player’s attendance at and participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill and/or conditioning program upon terms and conditions agreed upon by the Team and player (subject to the provisions of Section 12(c) below). Any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) of this Section 3(b) must be structured so as to provide an incentive for positive achievement by the player and/or the Team; and any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (ii) must be based upon specific numerical benchmarks or Generally Recognized League Honors. By way of example and not limitation, an amendment agreed upon pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) may provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage exceeds eighty percent (80%), but may not provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage improves over his previous Season’s percentage. For purposes of any bonus agreed upon pursuant to subsection (ii), the performance benchmarks must be based solely upon official NBA statistics, and the determination of whether a player has earned any such performance bonus shall be made solely by reference to official NBA statistics as published on NBA.com.</p></li>
<li><p>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) with respect to extra promotional appearances to be performed by the player (in addition to those required by Paragraph 13 of such Contract) and the Compensation therefor.</p></li>
<li><p>By agreeing upon a Compensation payment schedule (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) different from that provided for by Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract; provided, however, that such amendment shall comply with the provisions of Section 3(b) above (relating to lump sum bonus payments) and Section 13(e) below and, provided, further that: (i) the only such amendment that shall be permitted with respect to any Season in which the player’s Compensation is not greater than the Minimum Player Salary shall be as described in Section 6(g) or Section 11(a)(ii) below; and (ii) the only such amendments that shall be permitted with respect to any Season in which the player’s Compensation is greater than the Minimum Player Salary shall be as follows: (y) a Uniform Player Contract may provide for the player’s Compensation (other than advances pursuant to clause (z) below and amounts paid on a deferred basis in accordance with Article XXV of this Agreement) to be paid in either twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments or thirty-six (36) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on November 1 of each year covered by the Contract and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month until said Compensation is paid in full; and (z) a Uniform Player Contract that, at the time the Contract is signed, is fully or partially protected for lack of skill and injury or illness for a Season may provide for the player to be paid a portion of his Compensation for such Season, up to the Maximum Advance Amount as defined below, prior to November 1 of such Season. The Maximum Advance Amount for a Season shall equal the lesser of eighty percent (80%) of the amount of the player’s Compensation for such Season that is protected for lack of skill and injury or illness, or fifty percent (50%) of the player’s Base Compensation for such Season; provided that no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the player’s Base Compensation for such Season may be paid to the player prior to the October 1 immediately preceding the first day of the Regular Season.</p></li>
<li><p>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1A to a Uniform Player Contract) stating that the Contract is intended to provide for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind) for each Season of the Contract for rendering the services and performing the obligations described in such Contract, in accordance with Section 6 below.</p></li>

<li><p>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 10 to a Uniform Player Contract), subject to Section 11(h) below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>entitling a player to receive a bonus (the “Exhibit 10 Bonus”) in an amount between $5,000 and the “Maximum Exhibit 10 Bonus Amount” (defined below) for the Salary Cap Year in which the Contract is signed if (1) the Contract is terminated by the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure prior to the first day of the Regular Season, and (2) the player (a) signs with the NBAGL prior to the deadline set by the NBAGL for NBAGL teams to designate affiliate players, (b) is initially assigned by the NBAGL to such Team’s NBAGL affiliate as listed in Exhibit 10 and timely reports to such affiliate, and (c) does not leave the NBAGL (e.g., by buying out his contract with the NBAGL and signing a contract with an international team) prior to providing sixty (60) consecutive days of service during the NBAGL Season (the “60-Day Service Period”), provided that, in the event the player is signed to one or more Contract(s) by the Team prior to completing the 60-Day Service Period, the player shall still satisfy this clause (c) if he timely returns to such Team’s NBAGL affiliate upon the completion or termination of such Contract(s) and completes the outstanding portion of the 60-Day Service Period. For clarity, a player will not satisfy this clause (c) if at any time prior to completing the 60-Day Service Period he signs a contract with a professional basketball team other than the Team. In the event a player fails to satisfy clause (c) above as a result of an injury resulting directly from his playing for the Team’s NBAGL affiliate, such player shall nonetheless be entitled to receive the Exhibit 10 Bonus set forth in his Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, an Exhibit 10 may only contain an Exhibit 10 Bonus if the Team has an NBAGL affiliate at the time of the execution of the Contract; provided, however, that if a Team with an NBAGL affiliate acquires by assignment a Contract with a Conversion Protection Amount but without an Exhibit 10 Bonus (the “Acquired Exhibit 10”), the Acquired Exhibit 10 shall be deemed to include an Exhibit 10 Bonus equal to the Conversion Protection Amount; and</li>
<li>stating that, if prior to the first day of the Regular Season (A) the Team exercises the Two-Way Player Conversion Option in accordance with Section 11(h) below, and/or (B) the Contract is not terminated by the Team, the Compensation provided for by the Contract will be protected for lack of skill and injury or illness in an amount (the “Conversion Protection Amount”) between $5,000 and the Maximum Exhibit 10 Bonus Amount; provided, however, that if the Exhibit 10 contains an Exhibit 10 Bonus, the Exhibit 10 must also contain a Conversion Protection Amount and the Conversion Protection Amount must be equal to the Exhibit 10 Bonus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “Maximum Exhibit 10 Bonus Amount” shall be: (1) $75,000 for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, and (2) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year, $75,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Salary Cap for the applicable Salary Cap Year and the denominator of which is the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.</p>
<p>In the event that NBAGL rules permit a Team, other than the Team that last requested waivers on the player, to designate the player as an affiliate player (the “Designating Team”), the Designating Team shall be responsible for paying the Exhibit 10 Bonus to the player provided that (a) the Designating Team designates the player as an affiliate player, (b) prior to the waiver, the Designating Team was a party to the Contract containing the Exhibit 10 Bonus, and (c) the player satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3(s)(i) above with respect to the Designating Team’s NBAGL affiliate.</p>
<p>With respect to a player, if the NBAGL affiliate of an NBA Team is permitted, pursuant to NBAGL rules, to designate the player as a returning player (such NBA Team, the “Returning Rights Team”), then any Team other than the Returning Rights Team shall, prior to entering into a Contract containing an Exhibit 10 with the player, be required to provide written notice to the player (with a copy to the Players Association) that, pursuant to NBAGL rules, the NBAGL affiliate of the Returning Rights Team holds the right to so designate the player. The NBA shall impose a fine of no less than $25,000 on any Team that fails to provide the notice required by this paragraph.</p>
<p>No Team may (a) be a party at any one time to more than six (6) Contracts containing an Exhibit 10, or (b) enter into a Player Contract with an Exhibit 10 unless such Contract is for one (1) Season in length, provides for the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind other than the Exhibit 10 Bonus), and does not provide for Compensation protection of any kind pursuant to Section 3(i) above (other than in connection with Section 3(s)(ii) above).</p>
<p>A Team may enter into a Contract with both an Exhibit 9 and an Exhibit 10 in accordance with the preceding terms; provided, however, that if a Team exercises its Two-Way Player Conversion Option, the Contract’s Exhibit 9 shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect upon the exercise of such Two-Way Player Conversion Option.</p></li>

<li><u><strong>Basketball-Related Injury.</strong></u> When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to Paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player’s failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player’s disability and/or unfitness to play skilled basketball as a direct result of an injury sustained while participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(c) or Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs 7(b), 7(c), 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player’s right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 (or Exhibit 1A or Exhibit 1B, as applicable) to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such injury does not result from the player’s participation in activities prohibited by Paragraph 12 of the Uniform Player Contract (as such Paragraph may be modified in Exhibit 5 to the Player Contract), attempted suicide, intentional self-inflicted injury, abuse of alcohol, use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance, abuse of or addiction to prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission of any felony for which the player is convicted (including by a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere), participation in any riot, insurrection, or war or other military activities, or failure to comply with the requirements of Paragraphs 7(d)-(i) of the Uniform Player Contract; (ii) at the time of the player’s termination, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player’s injury, the player cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise, and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by or on behalf of the insurance company in connection with the Team’s efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner described above) with the Team and the insurance company in the processing of the Team’s claim under such policy.</li>

<li><u><strong>Mental Disability.</strong></u> When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to Paragraph 16(a)(iv) thereof, by reason of the player’s failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player’s mental disability, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in this Section 4(e) or Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract, or expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs 16(a)(iii), 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team shall in no way affect the player’s (or his duly appointed legal representative’s) right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 (or Exhibit 1A or Exhibit 1B, as applicable) to such Contract in the amounts and at the times called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that: (i) such mental disability does not result from the player’s participation in activities prohibited by Paragraph 12 of the Uniform Player Contract (as such Paragraph may be modified in Exhibit 5 to the Player Contract), attempted suicide, intentional self-inflicted injury, the use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance, abuse of or addiction to prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission of any felony for which the player is convicted (including by a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere), participation in any riot, insurrection, or war or other military activities, or failure to comply with the requirements of Paragraphs 7(d)-(i) of the Uniform Player Contract; (ii) at the time of the player’s failure to render playing services, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player’s mental disability, the player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative) cooperates with the Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of him, completing application forms, or otherwise, and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of him by the insurance company in connection with the Team’s efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player (and/or his duly appointed legal representative) cooperates (in the manner described above) with the Team and insurance company in the processing of the Team’s claim under such policy.</li>
<li>No agreement by a Team to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract shall require (or be construed as requiring) such Team to continue to employ the player (whether on the Active List, Inactive List, Two-Way List, or otherwise); nor shall any such agreement afford the player any right to be employed, or to be deemed as having been employed, by such Team for any purpose.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract, and such protection is contingent on the satisfaction of a condition expressly set forth in Exhibit 2 to that Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the Player Contract has not previously been terminated at the time such condition is satisfied.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for in any Option Year in favor of the Team included in a Uniform Player Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the option to extend the term provided for in the Contract was exercised by the Team prior to the termination of the Contract. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Compensation provided for in any Option Year in favor of the player, the applicability of such protection in the circumstance where the Option has not been exercised by the player shall be governed by the provisions of Article XII, Section 2(a).</li>
<li>During the term of a Player Contract, the percentage of protected Base Compensation for any future Season shall not exceed the percentage of unearned protected Base Compensation for any prior Season. Thus, for example, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50%) Base Compensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one hundred percent (100%) Base Compensation protection in the second Season of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a Team from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a future Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of Base Compensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition cannot be satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example, it is permissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation protection for the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent (50%) and Base Compensation protection for the second Season will be increased from fifty percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) if the player is on the Team’s roster as of the August 1 prior to the second Season of the Player Contract.</li>
<li>With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after the effective date of this Agreement:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation that can be protected for death is thirty million dollars ($30,000,000); and</li>
<li>If a player (other than a player signed to a Contract that provides in any Season for the player to earn Compensation equal to his applicable Minimum Player Salary that (x) is signed after the first day of the Regular Season, or (y) does not provide for full Base Compensation protection for lack of skill and injury or illness for the first Season of such Contract) elects to purchase term life insurance for his benefit, his Team shall be permitted to reimburse him each Season for the premiums paid for such insurance with respect to such Season and any other future Season(s); provided, however, that:
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>The amount of coverage for which premiums are reimbursed by the Team in any Season shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation for such Season and each remaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not yet exercised) that is not protected for death, and (y) the difference between (i) eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000) and (ii) the aggregate amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation for such Season and each remaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not yet exercised) that is protected for death.</li>
<li>Any such premium reimbursement shall not exceed the cost for ten-year guaranteed term coverage at preferred rates.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If a Contract contains death protection covering ten million dollars ($10,000,000) or more of Base Compensation, the player shall be precluded from purchasing life insurance for a period of ninety (90) days following the execution or extension (as applicable) of the Contract or until such earlier time as the Team notifies the player in writing that it is no longer attempting to purchase life insurance coverage on the player (up to the amount of the player’s Base Compensation protection for death) for the Team’s benefit. During such ninety (90) day period or until such time as the Team issues the foregoing written notification to the player, the Team’s efforts to purchase life insurance on the player for the Team’s benefit shall be conducted diligently and in good faith.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after the effective date of this Agreement, in the event that a Team terminates a Player Contract (resulting in the player’s separation of service from the Team), and the Team is obligated thereafter to make payments to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract, such payments shall be made in accordance with the following schedule:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>If, as of the date of the player’s separation from service, the aggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract is five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or less, such amount shall be paid in accordance with the semi-monthly installments prescribed by the payment schedule set forth in the Contract. Each installment shall equal the amount of Base Compensation that was due per pay period for the applicable Season immediately before the Player’s separation until the aggregate amount of the remaining Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract is paid in full.</li>
<li>If, as of the date of the player’s separation from service, the aggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), such amount shall be paid as follows:
<ol start="24" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Base Compensation, if any, owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect to the “current season” (as defined below) at the time when the request for waivers on the player is made shall be paid in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the Contract. Each installment shall equal the amount of Base Compensation that was due per pay period immediately before the player’s separation until the aggregate amount of the remaining Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect to the current season is paid in full. For purposes of this subparagraph (x) and subparagraph (y) below only, the “current season” means the period from September 1 through June 30.</li>
<li>The remaining Base Compensation, if any, owed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall be aggregated and paid in equal amounts per year over a period equal to twice the number of NBA Seasons (including any Season covered by a Player Option Year) remaining on this Contract following the date upon which the request for waivers occurred, plus one NBA Season. For this purpose, if the request for waivers is made during the period from September 1 through June 30, the number of NBA Seasons remaining on this Contract shall not include the current season (as defined in subparagraph (x) above). The rescheduled payments described above shall be paid over the applicable number of NBA Seasons in equal semi-monthly installments on the pay dates prescribed by Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract.</li>
</ol>
The following example is for clarity. A player has four (4) Seasons remaining on his Contract with protected Base Compensation of the following amounts: $4 million in Season 1, $4.3 million in Season 2, $4.7 million in Season 3, and $5 million in Season 4. The player is waived on December 1 of Season 1. Under Section 4(k)(ii)(x) above, the player would receive the remainder of his $4 million in Base Compensation for Season 1 in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in his Contract. Under Section 4(k)(ii)(y) above, the $14 million of protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 2-4 of the Contract would be paid at a rate of $2 million per Season for the next seven (7) Seasons in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract. If the same player is instead waived on July 30 prior to Season 1, the $18 million of protected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 1-4 of the Contract would be paid – under Section 4(k)(ii) above – at a rate of $2 million per Season for the next nine (9) Seasons in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract.</li>

<li>In addition to the standard conditions or limitations set forth above in this Section 4 (as set forth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract), a Team and a player are authorized under Article II, Sections 4(a)-(e) to negotiate additional conditions or limitations applicable to the player’s Compensation protection for such categories as the Team and player agree to protect that relate to only the following: (i) whether the Team waives a player by a certain time (e.g., providing that a player’s Base Compensation protection increases if the Team does not request waivers on the player by a certain date); (ii) achievement of certain benchmarks relating to Team and/or player performance or a player’s physical condition (e.g., providing that a player’s Base Compensation protection increases if the player achieves certain performance criteria or meets specified weigh-in criteria), provided that any such performance benchmarks must be based solely upon official NBA statistics, the determination of whether a player has met any such performance benchmark shall be made solely by reference to official NBA statistics as published on NBA.com, and any amendment agreed upon pursuant to this subsection is structured so as to provide an incentive for positive achievement by the Team and/or the player; (iii) a player experiencing a particular injury, illness, or other medical condition (e.g., providing that a player’s Base Compensation protection does not apply if the Team terminates a Contract due to a particular injury to a player’s left knee); and (iv) the Team’s ability to obtain insurance, using best efforts, of a certain type and dollar amount within a specified period of time following execution or extension (as applicable) of the Contract. Other than the standard conditions or limitations set forth above in this Section 4 (as set forth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract) and any individually-negotiated conditions or limitations in accordance with this Section (l), no Player Contract entered into or extended on or after the effective date of this Agreement (but in the case of Extensions only with respect to the extended term) may contain any additional condition or limitation of any kind on a player’s Compensation protection.</li>

The Minimum Annual Salary Scale applicable to a player’s Contract is determined by the Salary Cap Year encompassing the first Season covered by the Contract. Accordingly, for example, if the first Season covered by a player’s Contract is the 2023-24 Season, then the Minimum Annual Salary Scale for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year shall apply for each Season of the Contract.</p></li>

<li><p>The Salary provided for in a Two-Way Contract (the “Two-Way Player Salary”) for a Season shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the Minimum Annual Salary called for under Article II, Section 6(a) for a player with zero (0) Years of Service (irrespective of how many Years of Service the player has accrued prior to the Contract or accrues during the term of the Contract), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the Regular Season as of the date such Contract is entered into (including the day on which the Contract is entered into), and the denominator of which is the total number of days of that Regular Season.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Two-Way Contract may include or provide for any (A) bonuses or Incentive Compensation of any kind, (B) deferred compensation, or (C) loans.</p></li>
<li><p>Every Two-Way Contract must contain an Exhibit 1B and include the following sentence in such Exhibit (which shall be deemed amended in the manner described in such sentence): “This Contract is intended to provide for a Base Compensation for the ____________ Season(s) equal to the Two-Way Player Salary for such Season(s) (with no bonuses of any kind) and shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to so provide.”</p></li>
<li><p>A Two-Way Contract that, at the time the Two-Way Contract is signed, is partially protected for lack of skill and injury or illness for a Season may be amended to provide for the Two-Way Player to be paid a portion of his Base Compensation for such Season (the “Advance”), up to the Two-Way Contract Advance Limit as defined below, prior to November 1 of such Season. The Two-Way Contract Advance Limit for a Season shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the Two-Way Player’s Base Compensation for such Season that is protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of signing. Any Advance paid to a player for a Season pursuant to the foregoing must be deducted from the first installment of Base Compensation (i.e., on November 1) and, if and as necessary after reducing in full the first installment, each subsequent installment of Base Compensation for such Season that such player would have received pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract had there been no such Advance. To effectuate the requirement set forth in the preceding sentence, every such Two-Way Contract that provides for an Advance must contain the following language (and, with respect to an Advance, only such language) in Exhibit 1B with respect to each applicable Season:</p>

In addition, a Two-Way Contract may also provide for Base Compensation protection for a Season to increase to up to fifty percent (50%) of the Base Compensation provided for by such Contract for such Season if the Team does not request waivers on the player by a certain date that is on or after the first day of the Regular Season encompassed by such Season.</li>
<li>The “Maximum Two-Way Protection Amount” shall be $75,000 for the 2023-24 Season, and for each subsequent Season shall be $75,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Salary Cap for the Salary Cap Year encompassing the applicable Season and the denominator of which is the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.</li>
<li>If a Team assigns or terminates a Player Contract that contains aggregate Base Compensation protection in respect of the then-current and any future Salary Cap Year that exceeds the Maximum Two-Way Protection Amount for the Season encompassed by the Salary Cap Year in which such assignment or termination occurs, then, during such Salary Cap Year, the player shall be precluded from: (x) playing under an NBAGL contract for such Team’s NBAGL affiliate, and (y) entering into a Two-Way Contract with such Team.</li>

<li>No Team may sign a player to a Two-Way Contract after March 4 of any Season.</li>
<li>No Team may sign or convert a player to a Two-Way Contract if the player has or may have four (4) or more Years of Service at any point during the Contract. For example, a player with three (3) Years of Service would not be eligible to sign a Two-Way Contract with a term of two (2) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Team may sign or convert a player who has four (4) Years of Service to a Two-Way Contract covering no more than one (1) Season if the player was credited with one (1) or more Years of Service in respect of a Season in which he (A) did not play in a Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff game and (B) was on a Team’s roster at all times from the first day of the Regular Season through the end of the last day of the Regular Season.</li>
<li>No Team may sign or convert a player to a Two-Way Contract, or acquire a Two-Way Contract by means of assignment, if, as a result, the player would or could be under a Two-Way Contract for any part of more than three (3) Salary Cap Years with the same NBA Team. For example, a player who completes a two-year Two-Way Contract with a Team could not subsequently sign a two-year Two-Way Contract with that Team.</li>

<li><p><U><strong>Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option.</strong></U> Every Two-Way Contract shall provide the Team with an option to convert the Two-Way Contract during its term to a Contract that is not a Two-Way Contract (“Standard NBA Contract”) that provides for a Salary for each Salary Cap Year equal to the player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary and a term equal to the remainder of the original term of the Two-Way Contract beginning on the date such option is exercised (“Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option”). Such player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary shall be determined in accordance with Section 6 above. For the day the Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option is exercised, the player shall be compensated only under the new Standard NBA Contract, and not under his Two-Way Contract. The Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may be exercised at any point during the period beginning on July 1 and ending just prior to the start of the Team’s last Regular Season game in each Salary Cap Year covered by the Two-Way Contract. Upon conversion, such Contract shall become a Standard NBA Contract and shall no longer be governed by the provisions of this Agreement governing Two-Way Contracts. To effectuate the requirements set forth in the preceding sentences, every Two-Way Contract with an Exhibit 1B must contain the following language (and only such language) under the “Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option” heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Team shall have the option to convert this Contract to a Standard NBA Contract (”Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option”). Team’s Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may be exercised by providing written notice to Player that is either personally delivered to Player or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of Player or his representative with a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If Team exercises the Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option, the Base Compensation amount set forth above in this Exhibit 1B will immediately become null and void and of no further force or effect, Player’s Compensation shall be equal to the Player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for a term equal to the remainder of the original term of this Contract beginning on the date such option is exercised, and all other terms and conditions of this Contract, including the Base Compensation protection set forth in Exhibit 2 (if any), shall remain applicable.”</p>

<li>The Team’s determination that the player has passed the physical examination shall be a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract. Accordingly, and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, until such time as a player has passed the physical examination, the prohibitions set forth in Section 13(b) above shall continue to apply to the Team and player.</li>
<li>A Required Tender or a Qualifying Offer may contain an Exhibit 6. If a player accepts such a Required Tender or Qualifying Offer but does not pass the required physical examination, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall be deemed to have been withdrawn, which shall have the consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as the case may be.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A player who knows he has an injury, illness, or other medical condition that renders, or he knows will likely render, him unable to perform the playing services required under a Player Contract may not validly enter into such Contract without prior written disclosure of such injury, illness, or other medical condition to the Team.</li>
<li>Neither the IST Finals Game, Play-In Games, nor a Team’s or a player’s performance during any such games, shall be considered for purposes of determining whether, as a result of his achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks related to a player’s performance as a player or the Team’s performance during a particular Season:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The player has earned a Performance Bonus included in his Player Contract in accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) above; or</li>
<li>Any additional conditions or limitations applicable to a player’s Compensation protection in accordance with Section 4(l)(ii) above have been satisfied.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>No Player Contract may provide for (x) one (1) or more Performance Bonuses in accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) above, or (y) any additional conditions or limitations applicable to Compensation protection in accordance with Section 4(l)(ii) above, that are in either or both cases based in whole or in part on:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The Team’s or the player’s performance during any In-Season Tournament games or Play-In Games;</li>
<li>The Team qualifying to participate in any In-Season Tournament knockout stage game or winning the IST Finals Game; or</li>
<li>The Team qualifying to participate in one (1) or more Play-In Games;</li>
</ol>
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent a Player Contract from providing for (A) one (1) or more Performance Bonuses in accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) above, or (B) any additional conditions or limitations applicable to Compensation protection in accordance with Section 4(l)(ii) above, that are in either or both cases based in whole or in part on a player’s or Team’s performance in all Regular Season games.</li>

<p>If a Player Contract fails to take effect or becomes void as a result of a Commissioner disapproval, the player’s failure to pass a physical examination conducted pursuant to Exhibit 6 to such Contract, or the rescission of a trade conducted pursuant to Article VII, Section 8(e), then, in each such case:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the player as the Team possessed at the time of the execution of the Contract, including, without limitation, any such rights that the Team possessed pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(b), Article X, and Article XI;</li>
<li>any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that was outstanding at the time the Contract was executed shall continue in effect as if the Contract had not been executed (including if the original deadline for accepting the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer expired following the execution of the Contract), but for no fewer than six (6) business days following the Commissioner’s disapproval, the Team’s issuance of notice to the player that he did not pass the physical examination, or the rescission of such trade, as the case may be; and</li>
<li>in the case of a player who does not pass a physical examination pursuant to Exhibit 6: (i) the player shall not be permitted to accept such Required Tender or Qualifying Offer for a period of two (2) business days following his receipt of notice from the Team that he did not pass his physical examination, during which period the Team may elect to withdraw the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer, which shall have the consequences described in Article X, Section 4 or Article XI, Section 4, as the case may be; and (ii) if the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer is not withdrawn by the Team during this period, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall thereafter be deemed amended so as to eliminate any Exhibit 6 that may be contained therein.</li>
