<h1><span class="header-section-number">A</span> NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACT</h1>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT made this ______ day of ___________________, is by and between ________________________ (hereinafter called the “Team”), a member of the National Basketball Association (hereinafter called the “NBA” or “League”) and ___________________, an individual whose address is shown below (hereinafter called the “Player”). In consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter contained, the parties hereto promise and agree as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>TERM.</strong></p>
<p>The Team hereby employs the Player as a skilled basketball player for a term of ____ year(s) from the 1st day of September ____.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p>The services to be rendered by the Player pursuant to this Contract shall include: (a) training camp, (b) practices, meetings, workouts, and skill or conditioning sessions conducted by the Team during the Season, (c) games scheduled for the Team during any Regular Season, (d) Exhibition games scheduled by the Team or the League during and prior to any Regular Season, (e) if the Player is invited to participate, the NBA’s All-Star Game (including the Rookie-Sophomore Game) and every event conducted in association with such All-Star Game, but only in accordance with Article XXI of the Collective Bargaining Agreement currently in effect between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (hereinafter the “CBA”), (f) Playoff games scheduled by the League subsequent to any Regular Season, (g) promotional and commercial activities of the Team and the League as set forth in this Contract and the CBA, (h) any NBADL Work Assignment in accordance with Article XLI of the CBA, and (i) any service in the NBADL pursuant to a Two-Way Contract.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>COMPENSATION.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Subject to paragraph 3(b) below, the Team agrees to pay the Player for rendering the services and performing the obligations described herein the Compensation described in Exhibit 1, Exhibit 1A, Exhibit 1B, or Exhibit 10 hereto, as applicable (less all amounts required to be withheld by any governmental authority, and exclusive of any amount(s) which the Player shall be entitled to receive from the Player Playoff Pool). For Standard NBA Contracts, unless otherwise provided in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 1A, such Compensation shall be paid in twenty-four (24) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on November 15th of each year covered by this Contract (“contract year”) and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month until said Compensation is paid in full. For Two-Way Contracts, Compensation shall be paid as follows: (i) the Player’s Two-Way NBADL Salary shall be paid in twenty-four (24) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on November 15th of each contract year and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month until said Compensation is paid in full (each such payment date, a “Semi-Monthly Payment Date”); (ii) for each NBA Day of Service that the Player accrues prior to the first Semi-Monthly Payment Date and between each subsequent Semi-Monthly Payment Date (each such period, an “NBA Day of Service Payment Period”), the Player shall be paid a payment equal to (x) the Two-Way NBA Salary daily rate, less (y) the Two-Way NBADL Salary daily rate, multiplied by (z) the number of NBA Days of Service that the Player accrues during such NBA Day of Service Payment Period, with such payment, if applicable, made on the Semi-Monthly Payment Date two weeks after the completion of the NBA Day of Service Payment Period.</p></li>
<li><p>The Team agrees to pay the Player $2,000 per week, pro rata, less all amounts required to be withheld by any governmental authority, for each week (up to a maximum of four (4) weeks for Veterans and up to a maximum of five (5) weeks for Rookies) prior to the Team’s first Regular Season game that the Player is in attendance at NBA training camp or Exhibition games; provided, however, that no such payments shall be made if, prior to the date on which he is required to attend training camp, the Player has been paid $10,000 or more in Compensation with respect to the NBA Season scheduled to commence immediately following such training camp. Any Compensation paid by the Team pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered an advance against any Compensation owed to the Player pursuant to paragraph 3(a) above, and the first scheduled payment of such Compensation (or such subsequent payments, if the first scheduled payment is not sufficient) shall be reduced by the amount of such advance; except that in the case of Two-Way Players, any Compensation paid by the Team pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered an advance against such player’s Two-Way NBA Salary only, and the first scheduled payment of such Two-Way NBA Salary (or such subsequent payments, if the first scheduled payment is not sufficient) shall be reduced by the amount of such advance.</p></li>
<li><p>The Team will not pay and the Player will not accept any bonus or anything of value on account of the Team’s winning any particular NBA game or series of games or attaining a certain position in the standings of the League as of a certain date, other than the final standing of the Team.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>EXPENSES.</strong></p>
<p>The Team agrees to pay all proper and necessary expenses of the Player, including the reasonable lodging expenses of the Player while playing for the Team “on the road” and during the NBA training camp period (defined for this paragraph only to mean the period from the first day of training camp through the day of the Team’s first Exhibition game) for as long as the Player is not then living at home. The Player, while “on the road” (and during the NBA training camp period, only if the Player is not then living at home and the Team does not pay for meals directly), shall be paid a meal expense allowance as set forth in the CBA. No deductions from such meal expense allowance shall be made for meals served on an airplane. During the NBA training camp period (and only if the Player is not then living at home and the Team does not pay for meals directly), the meal expense allowance shall be paid in weekly installments commencing with the first week of training camp. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Player shall be considered to be “on the road” from the time the Team leaves its home city until the time the Team arrives back at its home city.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CONDUCT.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The Player agrees to observe and comply with all Team rules, as maintained or promulgated in accordance with the CBA, at all times whether on or off the playing floor. Subject to the provisions of the CBA, such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and shall be binding upon the Player.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees: (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii) to be neatly and fully attired in public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off the court according to the highest standards of honesty, citizenship, and sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or the League.</p></li>
<li><p>For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance with the terms of the CBA.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees to be bound by Article 35 of the NBA Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto. The Player acknowledges that the Commissioner is empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes and in the manner provided in such Article, provided that such fines and/or suspensions are consistent with the terms of the CBA.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment, shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet, money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by any Team or NBADL team, the Commissioner shall have the power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a player for any Team, and the Commissioner’s finding and decision shall be final, binding, conclusive, and unappealable.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract, directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any NBA Team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such services, except with the prior written consent of such Team. Breach of this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the Commissioner.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, he shall be given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players Association), stating the amount of the fine or the duration of the suspension and the reasons therefor.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>WITHHOLDING.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA (or, as applicable, the NBADL or an NBADL team), the Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of a suspension, the amount provided in Article VI of the CBA (or, as applicable, Article XLI) from any Current Base Compensation due or to become due to the Player with respect to the contract year in which the conduct resulting in the fine and/or the suspension occurred (or a subsequent contract year if the Player has received all Current Base Compensation due to him for the then current contract year). If, at the time the Player is fined and/or suspended, the Current Base Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under this Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then the Player agrees promptly to pay the amount directly to the Team. In no case shall the Player permit any such fine and/or suspension to be paid on his behalf by anyone other than himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Any Current Base Compensation withheld from or paid by the Player pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the League, as the case may be, unless the Player contests the fine and/or suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the provisions of the CBA. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies Article XXXI, Section 14 of the CBA, the amount withheld from the Player shall be placed in an interest-bearing account, pursuant to Article XXXI, Section 10 of the CBA, pending the resolution of the Grievance.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>PHYSICAL CONDITION.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team in good physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA Season in good physical condition.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, unfit to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player until such time as, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is in sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension, the Base Compensation payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length of such Season. Nothing in this subparagraph shall authorize the Team to suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.</p></li>
<li><p>If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, the Team will pay the Player’s reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses (including doctor’s bills), provided that the hospital and doctor are selected by the Team, that the Team shall be obligated to pay only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. The Team will also pay costs associated with a second opinion in accordance with Article XXII, Section 10 of the CBA. Subject to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player’s injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full Base Compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player the Base Compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such Season (or in the case of a Two-Way Contract, so long as such unfitness continues but in no event after the Two-Way Player has received his Two-Way Annual NBADL Salary for such NBADL Regular Season (prorated as necessary if the Two-Way Contract was entered into after the start of the NBADL Regular Season) plus (i) any Two-Way NBA Salary earned by such Two-Way Player during such NBA Regular Season prior to the date of such unfitness, less (ii) such Two-Way Player’s Two-Way NBADL Salary covering the number of NBA Days of Service accrued by such Two-Way Player during such NBA Regular Season prior to the date of such unfitness). The Team’s obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (x) any workers’ compensation benefits, which, to the extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team, and (y) any insurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees to provide to the Team’s coach, trainer, or physician prompt notice of any injury, illness, or medical condition suffered by him that is likely to affect adversely the Player’s ability to render the services required under this Contract, including the time, place, cause, and nature of such injury, illness, or condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Should the Player suffer an injury, illness, or medical condition, he will submit himself to a medical examination, appropriate medical treatment by a physician designated by the Team, and such rehabilitation activities as such physician may specify. Such examination when made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees (i) to submit to a physical examination at the commencement and conclusion of each contract year hereunder, and at such other times as reasonably determined by the Team to be medically necessary, and (ii) at the commencement of this Contract, and upon the request of the Team, to provide a complete prior medical history.</p></li>
<li><p>The Player agrees to supply complete and truthful information in connection with any medical examinations or requests for medical information authorized by this Contract.</p></li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>A Player who consults or is treated by a physician (including a psychiatrist) or a professional providing non-mental health related medical services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist) other than a physician or other professional designated by the Team shall give notice of such consultation or treatment to the Team and shall provide the Team with all information it may request concerning any condition that in the judgment of the Team’s physician may affect the Player’s ability to play skilled basketball.</li>
<li>A Player who engages in five (5) or more training or workout sessions with a trainer, performance coach, strength and conditioning coach, or any other similar coach or trainer other than at the direction of the Team (each a “Third-Party Trainer”), shall give notice of such training or workout to the Team prior to the first such training or work out session, provided that if the player does not initially plan to continue working with any such Third-Party Trainer for five (5) or more sessions, such notice must be provided no later than prior to the fifth such session. This notice requirement shall not apply to workouts or training that exclusively involve jogging, road bicycling, swimming, yoga, Pilates and/or dance; and the Player’s failure to comply with such notice requirement shall not itself constitute a material breach of this Contract. For clarity with respect to counting multi-day training or workout sessions under this paragraph, any such session(s) shall be counted to equal the number of days on which such training or workouts occurred. Subject to the Team’s other rights, and the player’s other obligations, under the CBA and this Contract, including, for example, the player’s obligations under this Paragraph 7 to report in good physical condition and to submit to treatment and rehabilitation specified by a physician designated by the Team, a player will have the right in the off-season to work out with one or more Third-Party Trainers of his choosing and may not be disciplined for exercising that right.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure of medical information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII or XXXIII of the CBA, the Player shall execute such individual authorization(s) as may be requested by the Team or the Medical Director of the Anti-Drug Program or as may be required by health care providers who examine or treat the Player.</p></li>

<p>The Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in accordance with the express provisions of (i) Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug Program) of the CBA or (ii) the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse, and that any such termination will result in the Player’s immediate dismissal and disqualification from any employment by the NBA and any of its Teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations to pay Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay the Player’s earned Compensation (whether Current or Deferred) to the date of termination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UNIQUE SKILLS.</strong></p>
<p>The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique skill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him hereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing, attempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract, for any other person, firm, entity, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have the right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this Contract, and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person, firm, entity, or organization during the term of this Contract. The Player agrees that this right may be enforced by the Team or the NBA. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Team shall have the right to assign this Contract to any other NBA Team, and the Player agrees to accept such assignment and to faithfully perform and carry out this Contract with the same force and effect as if it had been entered into by the Player with the assignee Team instead of with the Team.</li>
<li>In the event that this Contract is assigned to any other NBA Team, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his family to the home territory of the Team to which such assignment is made, as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee Team.</li>
<li>In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA Team, the Player (or his agent) shall forthwith be provided notice of such assignment by phone or email. With respect to an assignment by trade, notice of the trade must be provided to the Player (or his agent) by phone or email either before conclusion of the trade call with the NBA or as soon as possible after the conclusion of the trade call (but in no event may such notification be made more than one (1) hour after the conclusion of the trade call or less than one (1) hour prior to the public announcement of the assignment). The Player shall report to the assignee Team within forty-eight (48) hours after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made during a Season), within one (1) week after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made between Seasons), or within such longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. The NBA shall also notify the Players Association of any such assignment as soon as practicable but in no event later than one (1) business day after such assignment occurs. The Player further agrees that, immediately upon reporting to the assignee Team, he will submit upon request to a physical examination conducted by a physician designated by the assignee Team.</li>
<li>If the Player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the Team to which this Contract has been assigned within the time provided in subsection (c) above, then (i) upon consummation of the assignment, the Player may be disciplined by the assignee Team or, if the assignment is not consummated or is voided as a result of the Player’s failure to so report, by the assignor Team, and (ii) such conduct shall constitute conduct prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution, and shall therefore subject the Player to discipline from the NBA in accordance with such Article.</li>

<li><strong>VALIDITY AND FILING.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>The Team agrees to file a copy of this Contract, and/or any amendment(s) thereto, with and as directed by the Commissioner of the NBA as soon as practicable by email, but in no event may such filing be made more than forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of this Contract and/or amendment(s).</li>
<li>If pursuant to the NBA Constitution and By-Laws or the CBA, the Commissioner disapproves this Contract (or any amendment(s) thereto) within ten (10) days from the first business day following the day on which this Contract (or amendment) is first received, as directed, in his office, this Contract (or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no further force or effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be relieved of their respective rights and liabilities thereunder, provided that such ten (10) day period shall be fifteen (15) days for any Contract (or amendment) so received during the period each year from July 1 through the date that is fourteen (14) days following the last day of the Moratorium Period. If the Commissioner’s disapproval is subsequently overturned in any proceeding brought under the arbitration provisions of the CBA (including any appeals), the Contract shall again be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player, and the Commissioner shall be afforded another ten-day period to disapprove the Contract (based on the Team’s Room at the time the Commissioner’s disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the foregoing sentence.

If the Player violates this Paragraph 12, he shall be subject to discipline imposed by the Team and/or the Commissioner of the NBA. Nothing contained herein shall be intended to require the Player to obtain the written consent of the Team in order to enable the Player to participate in, as an amateur, the sports of golf, tennis, handball, swimming, hiking, softball, volleyball, and other similar sports that a reasonable person would not recognize as involving or exposing the participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Player agrees to allow the Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity to take pictures of the Player, alone or together with others, for still photographs, motion pictures, television, or other Media (as such term is defined in Article XXVIII of the CBA), at such reasonable times as the Team, the NBA or the League-related entity may designate. No matter by whom taken, such images may be used in any manner desired by either the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity for publicity or promotional purposes for Teams or the NBA. The rights in any such images taken by the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity shall belong to the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity, as their interests may appear.</li>
<li>The Player agrees that, during any year of this Contract, he will not make public appearances, participate in radio or television programs, permit his picture to be taken, write or sponsor newspaper or magazine articles, or sponsor commercial products without the written consent of the Team, which shall not be withheld except in the reasonable interests of the Team or the NBA. The foregoing shall be interpreted in accordance with the decision in Portland Trail Blazers v. Darnell Valentine and Jim Paxson, Decision 86-2 (August 13, 1986).</li>
<li>Upon request, the Player shall consent to and make himself available for interviews by representatives of the media conducted at reasonable times.</li>
<li>In addition to the foregoing, and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in Article II, Section 8 of the CBA, the Player agrees to participate, upon request, in all other reasonable promotional activities of the Team, the NBA, and any League-related entity. For each such promotional appearance made on behalf of a commercial sponsor of the Team, the Team agrees to pay the Player $3,500 subject to Article II, Section 8 of the CBA, or, if the Team agrees, such higher amount that is consistent with the Team’s past practice and not otherwise unreasonable.</li>

<li><strong>LEAGUE PROMOTION.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The NBA, all League-related entities, and the Teams may use, and may authorize others to use, in League Promotions, the Player’s name, nickname, picture, portrait, likeness, signature, voice, caricature, biographical information, or other identifiable feature (collectively, “Player Attributes”). The NBA, all League-related entities, and the Teams shall be entitled to use the Player’s Player Attributes individually pursuant to the preceding sentence and may, but shall not be required to, use the Player’s Player Attributes in a group or as one of multiple players. As used herein, “League Promotion” shall mean any and all uses intended to publicize, promote or market (including in any and all Media) (i) the NBA, any League-related entity that generates BRI (as defined in Article VII of the CBA), any Team, or any Player, (ii) any game in which a Team participates (including a Pre- Season, Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff game), including the sale of tickets to any such game, (iii) any telecast or other exhibition or distribution of (x) any such game or (y) any NBA-related or Team-related program or content, (iv) any NBA or Team facility, platform, or event, including the sale of tickets to any such event, or public service activity conducted by the NBA, a League-related entity that generates BRI, or a Team, or (v) the sport of basketball. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing rights of the NBA, League-related entities, and the Teams include the right and authority to use, and to authorize others to use, after the term of this Contract, any Player Attributes fixed in a tangible medium (e.g., filmed, photographed, recorded or otherwise captured) during the term of this Contract solely for the purposes described herein.</li>
<li>Paragraph 14(a) above does not confer any right or authority to (i) use the Player’s Player Attributes in a manner that constitutes an unauthorized Endorsement (as such term is defined and clarified in Article XXVIII of the CBA); (ii) use or authorize others to use the Player’s Player Attributes (including in any program, content, platform, facility or event) in a manner that constitutes an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion (as such term is defined and clarified in Paragraph 14(c) below); or (iii) authorize others (including any NBA sponsor or Team sponsor) to use the Player’s Player Attributes on any product, product packaging, service or service- related materials sold or distributed by any third party, or any associated premiums.</li>
<li>An “Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion” shall mean a use of the Player’s Player Attributes by a third party, or anyone on the third party’s behalf (including, without limitation, the NBA, any League-related entity or any NBA Team), to promote, market, or advertise the third party’s product, service, or brand; provided, however, the term Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion does not include the use of the Player’s Player Attributes (i) by, or on behalf of, a telecaster or distributor of NBA games to promote the telecast or distribution of such NBA game, the fact that such third party is the telecaster or distributor of NBA content (e.g., an advertisement promoting MSG as the “Home for New York Sports” that includes a photograph of a Knicks player; or an ESPN advertisement promoting ESPN as the “Worldwide Leader in Sports” that includes footage of NBA players), or other sports-related programming of the telecaster or distributor (but not related parties of the telecaster or distributor – e.g., the Player’s Player Attributes may be used to promote an e-commerce company’s video service that carries games and may carry other sports content, but may not be used to promote other products or services of the e-commerce company), (ii) by, or on behalf of, a telecaster or distributor of NBA programs or content to promote such NBA programs or content, (iii) by a third party, or anyone on the third party’s behalf, for use in the promotion of the sale of tickets to an NBA game or event, or the sale of player-identified merchandise, (iv) by a third party when jointly licensed by the Players Association, or (v) by, or on behalf of, a third party to promote, market or advertise the third party’s product, service or brand as part of a League Promotion or a promotional opportunity under Article XXVIII, Section 3(d)(y) of the CBA unless the execution (e.g., television advertisement, print ad, web ad) includes (x) more than (A) the third party’s brand name and/or logo (either or both) (which use may not be persistent within such execution), provided that it shall not be considered persistent use of a third party’s brand name and/or logo when used in conjunction with reference to the name and/or logo of the subject of such League Promotion for which the third party is a title or presenting sponsor (e.g., title sponsorship of the Slam Dunk Contest or a pre-game show) and (B) the subordinate and incidental promotion of the third party’s products and services (e.g., not a call to action for a specific product or service), or (y) more than the subordinate and incidental promotion of the third party’s products and services (it being understood that this clause (y) does not apply to an execution that includes the third party’s brand name and/or logo, but clause (x) above does apply).</li>
<li>In addition to Paragraph 14(c)(i) above, solely for the current term of the contracts in effect as of the execution date of the CBA, between the NBA, any League-related entity, or any NBA Team, on the one hand, and ABC/ESPN, TNT, or any regional, local or international telecasters or distributors of NBA games, on the other hand (such as MSG, FoxSports Ohio, or Tencent, Inc.) (each, a “Current Telecaster”), it shall not be an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion for a Current Telecaster to use Player Attributes to promote (I) itself and its sports programming or its other sports content and (II) to the extent currently authorized by those contracts, its non-sports programming and content; the term Current Telecaster does not include related parties of the Current Telecaster. It shall be an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion for the NBA, any League- related entity or any NBA Team to use the Player’s Player Attributes as described in subparagraph (c), where such use (A) promotes the products, services or brands of a third party that does not generate BRI, and (B) is not jointly licensed with the Players Association. Any dispute regarding whether a use of Player Attributes is or is not an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion shall be determined by the System Arbitrator on an expedited basis, as soon as possible following a hearing conducted within seventy-two (72) hours after commencement of the proceeding.</li>
<li>The Player does not and will not contest during or after the term of this Contract, and the Player hereby acknowledges, the exclusive rights of the NBA, all League-related entities that generate BRI and the Teams (i) to telecast, or otherwise distribute, transmit, exhibit or perform, on a live, delayed, or archived basis, in any and all Media, any performance by the Player under this Contract or the CBA (including in NBA games or any excerpts thereof) and (ii) to produce, license, offer for sale, sell, market, or otherwise, exhibit, distribute, transmit or perform (or authorize a third party to do any of the foregoing), on a live, delayed, or archived basis, any such performance in any and all Media, including, but not limited to, as part of programming or a content offering or in packaged or other electronic or digital media. The foregoing does not confer any right or authority to use the Player’s Player Attributes in a manner that constitutes an unauthorized Endorsement or Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion (as such terms are defined and clarified in Article XXVIII of the CBA and Paragraph 14(c) above) or any right which would violate Article XXVIII, Section 3(f) of the CBA. For purposes of clarity and without limitation, any use of a Player’s Player Attributes that has been expressly authorized by the Player (not including in this Contract) shall not be an unauthorized Endorsement or an Unauthorized Sponsor Promotion.</li>

If neither the Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or alleged failure to be remedied within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice, the Players Association shall, on behalf of the Player, have the right to request that the dispute concerning such alleged default or alleged failure be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the CBA. If, as a result of such arbitration, an award issues in favor of the Player, and if neither the Team nor the League complies with such award within ten (10) days after the service thereof, the Player shall have the right, by a further written notice to the Team and the League, to terminate this Contract.</p></li>

<li>If in the opinion of the Commissioner any act or conduct of a Player at or during an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has been prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such Player a fine not exceeding $50,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any such Player from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games, or he may order both such fine and suspension.</li>
<li>The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any Player who, in his opinion, (i) shall have made or caused to be made any statement having, or that was designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball or of the Association or of a Member, or (ii) shall have been guilty of conduct that does not conform to standards of morality or fair play, that does not comply at all times with all federal, state, and local laws, or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.0.2</span> EXCERPT FROM NBA BY-LAWS</h3>
<p>5.01. <em>Waiver Right.</em> Except for sales and trading between Members in accordance with these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option, or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the services of, or right to negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure prescribed by this Constitution and By-Laws.</p>
<p>5.02. <em>Waiver Price.</em> The waiver price shall be $1,000 per Player.</p>
<p>5.03. <em>Waiver Procedure.</em> A Member desiring to secure waivers on a Player shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee, who shall, on behalf of such Member, immediately notify all other Members of the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to have been waived unless a Member shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee in accordance with Section 5.04 of a claim to the rights to such Player. Once a Member has notified the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee of its desire to secure waivers on a Player, such notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility of the Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee has expired.</p>
<p>5.04. <em>Waiver Period.</em> If the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee distributes notice of request for waiver, any Members wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and in a Writing of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee within forty-eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. A Team may not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers. Notwithstanding Article 40 of the NBA Constitution, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be included when computing the above-referenced waiver period.</p>
<p>5.05. <em>Waiver Preferences.</em> (a) In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed the rights to a Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest team standing at the time the waiver was requested shall be entitled to acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for waiver shall occur after the last day of the Season and before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season shall govern. (b) If the winning percentage of two (2) claiming Teams are the same, then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular Season Games between the two (2) Teams during the Season or during the preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a consolidated standing shall control.</p>
<p>5.06. <em>Players Acquired Through Waivers.</em> A Member who has acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season.</p>
<p>5.07. <em>Additional Waiver Rules.</em> The Commissioner or the Board of Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to those set forth in this Section 5) with respect to the operation of the waiver procedure. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 5 and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member, and rules of construction as to time.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If, as of the date of the Player’s separation from service, the aggregate amount owed to the Player pursuant to this Exhibit 2 is two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or less, such amount shall be paid in accordance with the semi-monthly installments prescribed by the payment schedule set forth in this Contract.

<p>Player: ____________________________<br />
Team: ____________________________<br />
Date: ____________________________</p>
<p>Paragraph 7(b) is hereby deleted and the following shall be substituted in place and instead thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“7. (b) The Player agrees, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, that he will to the best of his ability maintain himself in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball at all times. If the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the physician designated for that purpose by the Team, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition, in either event so as to render the Player unfit in the reasonable judgment of said physician to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player for successive one-week periods until the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the Team’s physician, is in good physical condition; provided, however, that at the end of each such one-week period of suspension, if the Team notifies the Player, orally or in writing, that in its reasonable judgment it believes the Player is still not in good physical condition, and if the Player so requests, then the Player shall be examined by a physician or physicians designated for such purpose by the President, or any Vice President if the President is not available, of the American Society of Orthopedic Physicians, or equivalent organization (the”Reviewing Physician“), whose sole judgment concerning the physical condition of the Player to play skilled basketball shall be binding upon the Team and the Player for purposes of this paragraph. The suspension of the Player shall be terminated promptly upon the failure of the Team to give the Player the notice required at the end of the one-week period or upon the finding of said Reviewing Physician that the Player is in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball. In the event of a suspension permitted hereunder, the Compensation (excluding any signing bonus or Incentive Compensation) payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period of disability so determined bears to the length of the Season. Nothing in this paragraph 7(b) shall authorize the Team to suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.1.10</span> Exhibit 10 — NBADL Bonus and Two-Way Player Conversion</h3>
<p>Player: ___________________________<br />
Team: ____________________________<br />
Bonus Amount*: ______________________<br />
NBADL Affiliate: _____________________<br />
Conversion Protection Amount: ____________<br />
Date: ____________________________</p>
<p><strong>Contract Termination/NBADL:</strong> In the event this Contract is terminated by the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, the Player shall be entitled to receive from the Team the Bonus Amount (if applicable) provided above, provided that the Player (a) signs with the NBADL prior to the deadline set by the NBADL for NBADL teams to designate affiliate players, (b) is initially assigned by the NBADL to the NBADL affiliate listed above (or the NBADL affiliate of any Team that acquires the Contract, if applicable) and timely reports to such affiliate, (c) does not leave the NBADL (e.g., by buying out his contract with the NBADL and signing a contract with an international team) for a period of sixty (60) days after signing with the NBADL (“60-Day Bonus Window”), with such bonus payable (if applicable) within thirty (30) days after the 60-Day Bonus Window.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Way Player Conversion Option:</strong> Team shall have the option to convert this Contract to a Two-Way Contract (“Two-Way Player Conversion Option”); provided, however, that (a) such option must be exercised prior to the first day of the NBA Regular Season, and (b) may not be exercised if it would result in a violation of Article X, Section 4(d) of the CBA. Team’s Two-Way Player Conversion Option may be exercised by providing written notice to Player that is either personally delivered to Player or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of Player or his representative with a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If Team exercises the Two-Way Player Conversion Option, this Contract’s Exhibit 1A will immediately become null and void and of no further force or effect and the Player’s Compensation shall be equal to the Two-Way Player Salary applicable for such Season. Further, upon conversion, the Player’s right to the Bonus Amount (if applicable) set forth above pursuant to this Exhibit 10 will be rescinded and the Player’s Contract, notwithstanding the absence of an Exhibit 2, shall be protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at an amount equal to the Conversion Protection Amount in this Exhibit 10. All other terms and conditions of this Contract shall remain applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option:</strong> In the event the Two-Way Player Conversion Option is exercised by the Team, Team shall thereafter have the option to convert the Contract to a Standard NBA Contract (“Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option”). Team’s Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option may be exercised by providing written notice to Player that is either personally delivered to Player or his representative or sent by email or pre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of Player or his representative with a copy to the Players Association and the NBA. If Team exercises the Standard NBA Contract Conversion Option, the Base Compensation amount applicable to the Two-Way Contract as set forth in this Exhibit 10 will immediately become null and void and of no further force or effect, Player’s Compensation shall be equal to the Player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for such Season beginning on the date such option is exercised, and all other terms and conditions of this Contract, including the Base Compensation protection set forth in this Exhibit 10, shall remain applicable.</p>
<p>*Bonus Amount must be equal to the Conversion Protection Amount and may only be included if Team has an NBADL Affiliate.</p>
