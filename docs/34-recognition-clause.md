# RECOGNITION CLAUSE

The NBA recognizes the Players Association as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of all persons who are employed by NBA Teams as professional basketball players and/or who may become so employed during the term of any collective bargaining agreement between the parties or any extension thereof: (a) all persons who are employed by NBA Teams as professional basketball players; (b) all persons who have been previously employed by an NBA Team as professional basketball players who are seeking employment with an NBA Team as a professional basketball player; (c) all rookie players selected in each year's NBA Draft; and (d) all undrafted rookie players seeking employment with an NBA Team as a professional basketball player. The Players Association warrants that it is duly empowered to enter into this Agreement for and on behalf of such persons. The NBA and the Players Association agree that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such persons and NBA Teams may, on an individual basis, bargain with respect to and agree upon the provisions of Player Contracts, but only as and to the extent permitted by this Agreement.
