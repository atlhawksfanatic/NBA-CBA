<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly select a Medical Director who shall be a person experienced in the field of testing and treatment for substance abuse. The Medical Director shall have the responsibility, among other duties, for selecting and supervising the Counselors and other personnel necessary for the effective implementation of the Drugs of Abuse and Marijuana Programs, for making medical review determinations for Prohibited Substances other than SPEDs, for evaluating and treating players subject to such Programs, and for otherwise managing and overseeing such Programs, subject to the control of the NBA and the Players Association. To the extent practicable, the Medical Director shall select qualified retired NBA players to serve as Counselors.</li>

Such notice of discharge shall be effective as of the immediately following September 30; provided, however, that if the parties do not reach agreement by such September 30 as to who shall serve thereafter as the Medical Director, SPED Medical Director and/or the Independent Expert, as the case may be, each party shall, by the immediately following October 15, appoint a person who shall have no relationship to or affiliation with that party. Such persons shall then have until the immediately following December 1 to agree on the appointment of a new Medical Director, SPED Medical Director and/or Independent Expert. Until a new Medical Director, SPED Medical Director and/or Independent Expert has been appointed, the previous Medical Director, SPED Medical Director and/or Independent Expert shall continue to serve.</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The NBA and the Players Association shall form a Prohibited Substance Committee, which shall be comprised of one (1) representative from the NBA, one (1) representative from the Players Association, and three (3) individuals jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association who shall be experts in the field of testing and treatment for drugs of abuse and performance-enhancing substances.

<li>The members of the Prohibited Substances Committee shall meet (either in person or by conference call) at least once each Season and once each off-season (the “Annual Meetings”). The Annual Meetings shall be scheduled by the NBA after consultation with the Players Association. At the Annual Meetings, the Committee shall review the Program’s list of Prohibited Substances, and discuss general anti-doping issues (including, but not limited to, advances in drug testing science and technology, and modifications to relevant anti-doping policies of other sports organizations).

<li>As of September 1, 2017, and as of each successive September 1, either of the parties to this Agreement may discharge any jointly-selected member of the Prohibited Substances Committee by serving thirty (30) days’ prior notice upon that person and upon the other party to this Agreement. In the case of such discharge, or in the event a Committee member resigns, and if the parties are unable to agree on a replacement Committee member within thirty (30) days, then the parties shall request a list of seven (7) names of potential replacements prepared by the Medical Director and any remaining jointly-selected Committee members, and, within seven (7) days, shall select the necessary replacement by alternately striking names from the list until only one (1) remains.</li>

If a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a Drug of Abuse, Diuretic, or marijuana, the NBA shall not publicly disclose the particular Prohibited Substance involved, absent the agreement of the Players Association or the prior disclosure of such information by the player (or by a person authorized by the player to disclose such information). If a player is suspended or disqualified for conduct involving a SPED, the particular SPED shall be publicly disclosed along with the announcement of the applicable penalty.</li>

<li>Other than as reasonably required by the Reasonable Cause Testing procedure set forth in Section 5 below, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall divulge to any other person or entity (including their respective members, affiliates, agents, consultants, employees, and the player and Team involved):
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>that it has received information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance by a player;</li>
<li>that it is considering requesting, has requested, or has had a conference with the Independent Expert concerning the suspected use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance by a player;</li>
<li>any information disclosed to the Independent Expert; or</li>
<li>the results of any conference with the Independent Expert.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3(a)-(f) above, the NBA and the Players Association shall promptly advise and make available to each other all information either of them may have in their possession, custody, or control that provides cause to believe that a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.</li>
<li>Nothing contained in this Section 3 shall prohibit a Team from providing to the NBA information concerning whether a player is engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. For clarity, this Section 3(h) does not permit a Team to provide information to the NBA in violation of Section 17(d) below.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Testing conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII, whether by the NBA, the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, shall be conducted in compliance with scientifically accepted analytical techniques. Such testing shall also comply with Section 4(b) below, the collection procedures described in Exhibit I-3 (for urine collections) and Exhibit I-4 (for blood collections) to this Agreement, and such additional procedures and protocols as may be established by the NBA (after consultation with the Players Association) or the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the NBA and the Players Association). The NBA and the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director, as applicable (after consultation with the Players Association), are authorized to retain such consultants and support services as are necessary and appropriate to administer and conduct such testing.</li>
<li>If a player is selected for random drug testing pursuant to Section 6 below on a day he is scheduled to play a game, the following additional procedures will apply: (i) any blood testing must occur after the game; and (ii) for urine testing of a visiting team scheduled at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the shoot-around for that team commences, and for any tests that are not completed by the time the visiting team bus is scheduled to leave the arena or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the team will provide alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and accompanies him or them back to the Team’s hotel.</li>
<li>All tests conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII shall be analyzed by laboratories selected by the NBA and the Players Association, and certified by the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).</li>
<li>Any test conducted pursuant to this Article XXXIII will be considered “positive” for a Prohibited Substance under the following circumstances:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>If the test is for a Prohibited Substance other than a SPED or Diuretic and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-5.</li>
<li>If the test is for a SPED, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at the levels set forth in Exhibit I-6.</li>
<li>If a player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only); provided, however, that the NBA will use its best efforts (A) to have the drug testing collectors immediately notify the NBA when any player refuses to submit to a test or cooperate fully with the testing process, and (B) to provide such information to the Players Association as soon as possible thereafter; and provided, further, that (C) following any player’s refusal to submit to a test or failure to cooperate fully with the testing process, the drug testing collector shall wait ninety (90) minutes at the collection site, and (D) if the player submits to the test and cooperates fully with the testing process within such additional time, then his earlier refusal or failure to cooperate shall be excused and the test shall not be deemed positive under this Section 4(d).</li>
<li>If the player fails to submit to a scheduled test, without a reasonable explanation satisfactory to the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (for testing under the SPED Program only).</li>
<li>If the player attempts to substitute, dilute, or adulterate a specimen sample or in any other manner alter a test result (other than by testing positive for a Diuretic).</li>
<li>If the test is positive for a Diuretic, and it is confirmed by laboratory analysis at any detectable level.</li>
</ol></li>

Upon hearing the information presented, the Independent Expert shall immediately decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the player in question has been engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance. If the Independent Expert decides that such reasonable cause exists, the Expert shall thereupon issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player.</li>
<li>In evaluating the information presented to him, the Independent Expert shall use his independent judgment based upon his experience in substance abuse detection and enforcement. The parties acknowledge that the type of information to be presented to the Independent Expert is likely to consist of reports of conversations with third parties of the type generally considered by law enforcement authorities to be reliable sources, and that such sources might not otherwise come forward if their identities were to become known. Accordingly, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall be required to divulge to each other or to the Independent Expert the names (or other identifying characteristics) of their sources of information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, and the absence of such identification of sources, standing alone, shall not constitute a basis for the Expert to refuse to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to a player. In conferences with the Independent Expert, the player involved shall not be identified by name until such time as the Expert has determined to issue an Authorization for Testing with respect to such player in the form set forth in Exhibit I-1 to this Agreement.</li>
<li>Immediately upon the Independent Expert’s issuance of an Authorization for Testing with respect to a particular player, the NBA shall arrange for such player to undergo testing for Drugs of Abuse (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the use, possession, or distribution of a Drug of Abuse), for marijuana (if the authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s use, possession, or distribution of marijuana), or for SPEDs (if the Authorization for Testing was based on information regarding the player’s use, possession, or distribution of a SPED) no more than four (4) times during the six-week period commencing with the issuance of the Authorization for Testing. Such testing may be administered at any time, in the discretion of the NBA, without prior notice to the player.</li>
<li>In the event that the player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse pursuant to this Section 5, or tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv) or (v) above in connection with testing conducted pursuant to this Section 5, he shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below. If the player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED pursuant to this Section 5, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall suffer the applicable consequences of a positive test for the Prohibited Substance for which the Authorization for Testing was issued.</li>
<li>In the event that either the NBA or the Players Association determines that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, within the previous year, a player has engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment for use of a Prohibited Substance other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, it may, in lieu of requesting the testing procedure set forth in Section 5(a)-(d) above, request a hearing on the matter before the Grievance Arbitrator. If the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that, within the previous year, the Player has used, possessed, or distributed a Prohibited Substance, or has received treatment other than in accordance with the terms of this Article XXXIII, the player shall immediately be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) below, notwithstanding the fact that the player has not undergone the testing procedure set forth in this Section 5; provided, however, that if the Grievance Arbitrator concludes that the player has used or possessed marijuana or a SPED, he shall enter the Program and suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 below, as the case may be.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">33.12</span> Reinstatement.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>After a period of at least two (2) years from the time of a player’s dismissal and disqualification under Section 11(a) above, and after a period of at least one (1) year from the date of a First-Year Player’s dismissal and disqualification under Section 6(b) above, such player may apply for reinstatement as a player in the NBA. However, such player shall have no right to reinstatement under any circumstance and the reinstatement shall be granted only with the prior approval of both the NBA and the Players Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and sole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player’s dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player’s conduct since his dismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.</li>
<li>For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the opinion of the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable), successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable). For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 11(a) above in connection with a Drug of Abuse, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Drug of Abuse or Marijuana within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her professional judgment, for alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed. For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 11(a) above in connection with a SPED, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine and/or blood testing acceptable to the SPED Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive for a SPED within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.</li>
<li>The granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned upon random testing of the player or such other terms as may be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not such terms are contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.</li>
<li>Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 and is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this Section 12.</li>
<li>In the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to Section 6(b) above is approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been rendered null and void pursuant to Section 6(b) above, shall be deemed not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any NBA Team, except as specifically provided in this Section 12.</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>A First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”). Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Section 12(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the Minimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but not more than the Salary provided for in Section 12(f)(iii) below. If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal. If the previous Team fails to make a Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(f)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which the player serves the notice required by Section 12(f)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled pursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain tolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team that he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering playing services under a Player Contract with such Team, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with and begin rendering playing services for such team.</li>
<li>A First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous Team that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the Player’s Salary and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he was dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the previous Team enter into such Player Contract and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases and decreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(c)(1); provided, however, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed and disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale Contract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player’s new Contract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2) Option Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player’s new Contract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the Salary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and (B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those contained in the remaining Seasons of the Player’s Rookie Scale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under the new Contract, then the player’s Team shall retain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as it would have retained under Article XI following the completion of the player’s Rookie Scale Contract.</li>

<li>A Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 12 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which he was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”).

If the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player Contract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, then the player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted or an Unrestricted Free Agent, in accordance with the provisions of Article XI. If the previous Team fails to make a Required Tender, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12(g)(i) above, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a Tender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i), he is under contract to a professional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA at any point after the date on which he serves the notice required by Section 12(g)(i) and before the date on which the previous Team makes a Tender.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be no other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the NBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing; provided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test players solely for diagnostic purposes in order to provide satisfactory medical care. The results of any diagnostic drug testing conducted pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be used for any other purpose by the player’s Team or the NBA. If any Team is found to have tested a player in violation of this Section 13, the NBA will impose a substantial fine not to exceed $750,000 upon such Team pursuant to the NBA’s Constitution and By-Laws.</li>
<li>The penalties set forth in this Article XXXIII shall be the exclusive penalties to be imposed upon a player for the use, possession or distribution of a Prohibited Substance.</li>
<li>No Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date hereof shall include any term or provision that modifies, contradicts, changes, or is inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract (including any condition or limitation on salary protection other than the standard conditions or limitations specifically provided for in Article II, Section 4) or provides for the testing of a player for illegal substances. Any term or provision of a currently effective Uniform Player Contract that is inconsistent with paragraph 8 of such Contract shall be deemed null and void only to the extent of the inconsistency.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">33.14</span> Random HGH Blood Testing.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a player shall be required to undergo HGH Blood Testing at any time, without prior notice to the player, no more than two (2) times each Season and no more than one (1) time during each Off-Season. For purposes of this Section 14, the last day of a Season for a player shall be the day before that player’s Off-Season begins. The scheduling of testing and collection of blood samples will be conducted according to a random player selection procedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players Association, any Team or any player will have any involvement in selecting the players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the third-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provideadvance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security Representative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who will be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the testing location. HGH Blood Testing may also take place under Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing) and Section 9 (Steroids and Performance-Enhancing Drugs Program) above, and Section 15 (Additional Bases for Testing) below. (For clarity, the number of random blood tests for Human Growth Hormone pursuant to this Section 14 shall be in addition to the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited Substances called for in Section 6 above.) HGH Blood Testing may occur at the same time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs, subject to the procedures governing game-day blood testing set forth in Section 4(b) above and Exhibit I-4 to this Agreement.</li>
<li>In the event that a player tests positive for a Human Growth Hormone pursuant to this Section 14, he shall enter the SPED Program and suffer the consequences set forth in Section 9 above.</li>
<li>The isoform test for HGH blood testing will be used with corresponding decision limits issued by the World Anti-Doping Agency in June of 2014 (the “WADA Decision Limits”) for positive test results. (The WADA Decision Limits are 1.84 for kit 1 and 1.91 for kit 2 for male athletes.)</li>

The Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) may, in his or her professional judgment, also require such a player, without prior notice, to submit to testing for Prohibited Substances, provided that the frequency of such testing shall not exceed three (3) times per week and the duration of such testing shall not exceed one (1) year from the date of the player’s initial evaluation by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable).</li>
<li>Any player who is subject to in-patient or aftercare treatment in the Program and is formally charged with “driving while intoxicated,” “driving under the influence of alcohol,” or any other crime or offense involving suspected alcohol or illegal substance use shall, provided that the NBA has advised the Players Association, be required to submit to a urine test, to be conducted by the NBA, within seven (7) days of being so charged.</li>
<li>If, pursuant to Section 15(a) above, a player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse; (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv) or (v) above; or (iii) refuses or fails to submit to an evaluation or provide (or cause to be provided) the information requested by the Medical Director, but does not Come Forward Voluntarily within sixty (60) days of being requested to do so by the NBA (with notice to the Players Association), or if, pursuant to Section 15(b) above, a player tests positive for a Drug of Abuse, then, in either case the player shall advance two stages in the Drugs of Abuse Program—i.e., the player shall enter Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program (if the player had not previously entered Stage 1 of such Program), and the player shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above (if the player had previously entered Stage 1 or Stage 2 of such Program).</li>
<li>If, pursuant to Section 15(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for marijuana or a SPED, he shall suffer the applicable consequences set forth in Sections 8 or 9 above, as the case may be.

<li>If a player is or, within the previous six (6) months, (i) has been in possession of any device or product used or designed for substituting, diluting, or adulterating a specimen sample, or (ii) has been subject to a finding by another sports league or anti-doping organization that he has substituted, diluted or adulterated a specimen sample and that finding has not been overturned on appeal, that player shall be required to undergo testing for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the six-week period following his notification by the NBA of the commencement of such testing. If the player (i) tests positive for a Drug of Abuse or (ii) tests positive pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii), (iv) or (v) above, he shall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(a) above.

<li>If the designated physician of the player’s team advises the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) – at that time or at any time thereafter – that the Proposed Substance would create a possible adverse reaction with another prescription substance that the player is being administered, a discussion will be held among the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable), the prescribing physician and the designated team physician with respect to modifying one or both of the prescriptions so as to avoid the potential adverse reaction.</li>

<li>A longitudinal profile for exogenous testosterone will be established for each player (the “Longitudinal Profile”). The sole purpose of the Longitudinal Profile is to assist the laboratory selected by the parties to perform the analysis of primary specimens for urine tests under the Program (the “Laboratory”) in determining which specimens shall be subjected to carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (“IRMS”) analysis.</li>
<li>Players’ Longitudinal Profiles will be created pursuant to the protocol set forth in Exhibit I-7. The three (3) tests used to create the Longitudinal Profiles will be random tests conducted under Section 6 above, and the creation of the Longitudinal Profiles will not require any player to undergo any testing in addition to the required random testing set forth in Section 6 above.</li>
<li>Once a player’s Longitudinal Profile is established, the director of the Laboratory will consider the player’s Baseline Values (as defined in Exhibit I-7) in comparison to the normalized Testosterone concentration, normalized Epitestosterone concentration or the corresponding Baseline Testosterone/Epitestosterone ratio (collectively, the “Specimen Values”) of the player’s subsequent urine specimens and will determine, in his or her discretion, whether to conduct an IRMS analysis on a urine specimen. In addition, the Laboratory will randomly select urine specimens for IRMS analysis to ensure that such analysis is conducted on at least one (1) urine specimen from every player during each year covered by the Program (i.e., from October 1 through September 30).

Such reduction or rescission (if any) will be determined at the discretion of the Grievance Arbitrator.</li>
