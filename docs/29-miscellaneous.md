# MISCELLANEOUS

## Active Roster Size.

Each Team agrees to have twelve (12) or thirteen (13) players on its Active List and to have a minimum of eight (8) players on the bench for all Regular Season games. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Team may from time to time as appropriate, but for no more than two (2) consecutive weeks at a time during the Regular Season, have eleven (11) players on its Active List. During the period from the day following the last day of the Regular Season (or, for Teams that qualify for the playoffs, the day following the Team's last playoff game), until the day before the first day of the following Regular Season, the maximum number of players (including Two-Way Players) that a Team may carry on its Active List shall be twenty (20). Players on the Inactive List shall be transferred to the Active List on the day following the last day of the Regular Season (or, for Teams that qualify for the playoffs, the day following the Team's last playoff game).

## Inactive Roster.

Each Team agrees to have at least two (2) players on its Inactive List for all Regular Season games. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Team that has eleven (11) or twelve (12) players on its Active List may from time to time as appropriate, but for no more than two (2) consecutive weeks at any time during the Regular Season, have one (1) player on its Inactive List, and (ii) any Team that has thirteen (13) players on its Active List may have one (1) player on its Inactive List, and may, from time to time as appropriate, but for no more than two (2) consecutive weeks at any time during the Regular Season, have zero (0) players on its Inactive List. For each Two-Way Player that a Team places on the Active List or Inactive List, the minimum Inactive List requirements set forth in this Section 2 shall be increased by one (1) for that Team.

## Two-Way Roster.

(a) A Two-Way Player shall be placed on his Team's (i) Active List or Inactive List (as applicable) while the Two-Way Player is providing services to the NBA Team, and (ii) Two-Way List while the Two-Way Player is providing services to an NBADL team (or, during a period prior to the start of NBADL training camp or after the completion of the NBADL playoffs, while the player is not providing services to the NBA Team).
(b) The Two-Way List shall only exist between the first day of the NBA Regular Season and the last day of the NBA Regular Season (or, for Teams that qualify for the playoffs, the day of the Team's last playoff game). For Teams that do not qualify for the playoffs, all players on the Two-Way List of any such Team shall be transferred to the Active List on the day following the last day of the NBA Regular Season. For Teams that qualify for the playoffs, all players on the Two-Way List of any such Team shall be transferred to the Active List on the day following the Team's last playoff game.
(c) A Two-Way Player is not eligible to be designated on an NBA Team's playoff roster or participate in NBA playoff games, but is permitted to travel and practice with the Team and remain on the Team's Inactive List during the NBA playoffs; provided, however, that subject to Section 4 below, a player who was previously a Two-Way Player but who, prior to the start of the Team's last Regular Season game, either signs a Standard NBA Contract in accordance with Article II, Section 11(h) or has his Two-Way Contract converted by the Team to a Standard NBA Contract pursuant to Article II, Section 11(g), is eligible to be designated on an NBA Team's playoff roster and participate in playoff games.

## Playoff Eligibility Waiver Deadline.

Any player (including any Two-Way Player) with respect to whom a request for waivers has been made after March 1 is not eligible to participate in playoff games during the then-current Season unless the player has been acquired by a Team whose Active List is reduced to eight (8) players due to injury or illness. For clarity, the March 1 deadline occurs at the end of the day on March 1. Accordingly, if a waiver request is made in respect of a player any time on or before March 1 at 11:59 p.m. eastern time, that player will remain eligible for the playoffs.

## Minimum League-Wide Roster.

Beginning with the 2017-18 Season, if for two consecutive Regular Seasons (e.g., 2017-18 and 2018-19 or 2018-19 and 2019-20, but not 2017-18 and 2019-20), NBA Teams in the aggregate employ an average of less than fourteen and one-half (14.5) players (excluding Two-Way Players) per Team, then for each Regular Season covered by this Agreement that follows such consecutive two-year period, the minimum Inactive List requirements set forth in the first two sentences of Section 2 above shall be increased by one (1) ("League-Wide Roster Increase"), so that Teams would for the remaining Seasons of the term of this Agreement be required to employ fifteen (15) players per team (excluding Two-Way Players) except as permitted in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 above. The foregoing rule shall be measured following each Regular Season as follows:
    STEP 1: For each player signed to a Player Contract (including a Rest-of-Season or 10-Day Contract, but excluding a Two-Way Contract) during a Regular Season, determine the number of days during such Regular Season that such player was carried on his Team's Active List or Inactive List (hereinafter "Duty Days").
    STEP 2: Determine the total Duty Days for all players for such Regular Season by adding together the results for each player from Step 1.
    STEP 3: Multiply (x) the number of NBA Teams that played games during the applicable Regular Season, by (y) 2,480 days.
    STEP 4: If, for two consecutive Regular Seasons beginning with the 2017-18 Season, the result in Step 2 above is less than the result in Step 3 above, then the League-Wide Roster Increase will be triggered.
                  
## Playing Rules and Officiating.

(a) Up to four (4) representatives of the Players Association, three (3) of whom shall be active or recently retired players selected by the Players Association, shall be permitted to attend the meetings of and have a vote on the NBA Competition Committee with respect to issues relating to the NBA playing rules and officiating.

Seat locations for complimentary tickets provided by a Team under this Section 8 must be in the lower bowl of the arena and may not be on the floor (i.e., in front of the risers or permanent bowl seating or inside the dashers) or in a luxury suite (i.e., a private, enclosed area that is separate from the arena bowl, including, but not limited to, traditional enclosed suites, event level (bunker) suites, and party suites).
