<li>In addition to any other rights a Team or the NBA may have by contract (including but not limited to the rights set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 16 of the Uniform Player Contract) or by law:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>When a player (A) fails or refuses, without proper and reasonable cause or excuse, to render the services required by a Player Contract or this Agreement, or (B) is suspended by his Team or the NBA for failing or refusing, without proper and reasonable cause or excuse, to render the services required by a Player Contract or this Agreement, the Current Base Compensation payable to the player for the year of the Contract during which such failure or refusal and/or suspension occurs shall be reduced by 1/91.6th of the player’s Base Compensation for each missed Exhibition, Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff game; and</li>
<li>When a player is, for proper cause other than the player’s failure or refusal to render the services required by a Player Contract or this Agreement, suspended by his Team or the NBA in accordance with the terms of such Contract or this Agreement, the Current Base Compensation payable to the player for the year of the Contract during which such suspension occurs shall be reduced by (i) 1/145th of the player’s Base Compensation for each missed Exhibition, Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff game for any suspension of fewer than twenty (20) games and (ii) 1/110th of the player’s Base Compensation for each missed Exhibition, Regular Season, Play-In, or playoff game for any suspension of twenty (20) games or more (including any indefinite suspension that persists for twenty (20) games or more or consecutive suspensions for continuing acts or conduct that persist for twenty (20) games or more).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Notwithstanding Section 1(a)(ii) above, for the first game in a Season for which a player is suspended by the NBA, if such suspension is for conduct on the playing court (as that term is defined in Article XXXI, Section 9(c)) and is a one-game suspension, the Current Base Compensation payable to the player for the year of the Contract during which such suspension occurs shall be reduced by an amount equal to the player’s Current Base Compensation for such Season multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Regular Season. For clarity, for any other game for which such player is suspended by his Team or the NBA during such Season, the Current Base Compensation payable to the player for the year of the Contract during which such suspension occurs shall be reduced in accordance with Section 1(a) above.</li>
<li>In the event that, at the start of a Regular Season, (x) a player is a Free Agent who has games remaining to be served on a suspension that was previously imposed on him by the NBA either when he was under a Contract with a Team or when he was a Free Agent, and (y) such player, but for the remainder of the suspension to be served, is otherwise eligible and able to play, then:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The player’s suspension shall be deemed to have been served as of the day following the day on which the Team to which he was under contract when the suspension was imposed (or, if he was not under contract when the suspension was imposed, the last Team to which he was under contract prior to the suspension being imposed) has played a number of games in such Regular Season equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the number of games that remained to be served on the term of the suspension as of the first day of such Regular Season (rounded up to the nearest whole number); and</li>
<li>If the player subsequently signs one or more Player Contracts, the Current Base Compensation payable to the player for such Season (or, if he does not sign a Player Contract during such Regular Season, the first subsequent Season thereafter for which he signs a Player Contract) under one or more Contracts shall be reduced in accordance with Section 1(a) above for the number of games that remained to be served on the term of the suspension as of the first day of such Regular Season.</li>
</ol>
For clarity, if a player is a Free Agent on the first day of such Regular Season and subsequently signs a Player Contract before his suspension has been deemed to have been served pursuant to Section 1(c)(i) above, the number of games of the suspension that will be deemed to have been served as of the date he signs such Player Contract shall equal two-thirds (2/3) of the number of games played by his prior Team in such Regular Season as of the date he signs such Player Contract (rounded to the nearest whole number).</li>

<li>When a player, without proper and reasonable excuse, fails to attend a practice session scheduled by his Team, he shall be subject to the following discipline: (i) for the first missed practice during a Season – $2,500; (ii) for the second missed practice during such Season – $5,000; (iii) for the third missed practice during such Season – $7,500; and (iv) for the fourth (or any additional) missed practice during such Season – such discipline as is reasonable under the circumstances.</li>

<li>NBA players shall be required to attend and participate in educational and life skills programs designated as “mandatory programs” by the NBA and the Players Association. Such “mandatory programs,” which shall be jointly administered by the NBA and the Players Association, shall include a Rookie Transition Program (for rookies only), Team Awareness Meetings (which shall cover, among other things, substance abuse awareness, HIV awareness, gambling awareness, healthy relationships, mental health and wellness programming, and recommendations and educational materials regarding the health benefits of vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)), and such other programs as the NBA and the Players Association shall jointly designate as mandatory.</li>
<li>When a player, without proper and reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to attend a “mandatory program,” he shall be fined $20,000 by the NBA; provided, however, that if the player misses the Rookie Transition Program, he shall be suspended for five (5) games.</li>
<li>Each year, the NBA and Players Association shall work together to (i) identify players who did not attend a Rookie Transition Program (for rookies only) or a Team Awareness Meeting covering information relating to the Anti-Drug Program (e.g., because the player was signed to a Contract after such Team Awareness Meeting took place), and (ii) as soon as practicable, provide any such player with educational materials regarding the Anti-Drug Program.</li>

In the event that any information provided in a player’s request is inaccurate at the time it is submitted to the NBA or the Players Association, or in the event that such information later becomes inaccurate, the NBA or the Players Association may in their discretion withdraw their approval of the player’s request.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For clarity, any investments in or promotions or endorsements of entities that produce or sell products containing a form of cannabis (including, for clarity, a CBD form of cannabis) not expressly permitted by this Section 20 are prohibited. In the event a player engages in a prohibited investment, promotion, or endorsement, then, without limiting other NBA rights or remedies, the player shall be required to promptly dispose of his ownership interest in the prohibited investment and/or immediately terminate his participation in the prohibited promotion or endorsement, as applicable.</li>

<li>A player shall be subject to discipline imposed by the NBA for violations of NBAGL rules pertaining to gambling involving the NBA, NBAGL, and/or NBA-affiliated leagues that were committed during any prior period of time during which the player was subject to NBAGL rules relating to gambling. The NBA may impose such discipline only in circumstances where, and only to the extent that, discipline would be authorized by the NBA under this Agreement for the same conduct under NBA rules pertaining to gambling by players involving the NBA, NBAGL, and/or NBA-affiliated leagues.</li>
<li>Any player suspended by the NBAGL for violations of the NBAGL rules pertaining to gambling involving the NBA, NBAGL, and/or NBA-affiliated leagues who signs a Uniform Player Contract before the full term of the suspension is served shall serve the remainder of the suspension in the NBA. In addition, any player suspended under NBAGL rules pertaining to gambling involving the NBA, NBAGL, and/or NBA-affiliated leagues whose NBAGL contract ends before the full term of the suspension is served shall be subject to Article VI, Section 1(c) of this Agreement with respect to the NBAGL suspension if, at the start of the following NBA Regular Season, he is a Free Agent who has games remaining to be served on the NBAGL suspension. For purposes of Article VI, Section 1(c), the “Team to which he was under contract when the suspension was imposed” shall be deemed to be the NBA team, if any, with which the player first signs a Player Contract following imposition of the NBAGL suspension.</li>
