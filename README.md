# NBA-CBA

This is a repository which will host a bookdown version of the 2017 NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The literal pdf version of the CBA can be found on the [NBPA's website](http://3c90sm37lsaecdwtr32v9qof.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2017-NBA-NBPA-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf) as well as the `raw` folder of this repository. It is a 598 page legal document which provides various rules of competition within the labor market for NBA players.

The purpose of this repository is two-fold: 1) to provide easier navigation of the CBA through a structured format of each Article and Section and 2) for me to better understand the CBA through this exercise. The current version of the CBA does not contain a navigable table of contents or bookmarks to the different Articles and Sections of the agreement. This makes searching through the document cumbersome and frustrating. Enter [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) as a method for converting each Article in the CBA to it's own chapter in bookdown and each Section as a sub-chapter. This will also provide different formats for the document to viewed (HTML, PDF, e-book) which will make viewing the CBA easier.

Currently, the structure for links within the CBA is to always provide a link to the particular Article-Section or Exhibit which is referenced in a portion of the CBA (but only the first time it is referenced there). This is because bookdown will automatically provide an anchor for every Article and Section based upon its title.
