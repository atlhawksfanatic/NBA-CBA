## URINE COLLECTION PROCEDURES

During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to occur before practices on non-game days, and before shoot-arounds and games on game days. For random drug testing of a visiting team scheduled at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the shoot-around for that team commences, and for any tests that are not completed by the time the visiting team bus is scheduled to leave the arena or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the team will provide alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and accompanies him or them back to the Team's hotel. Random drug tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.

When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.

The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player will then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of the collector.

The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen of sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the presence of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and the other will be used as the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with tamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a unique identification number that corresponds to the number on the chain of custody form.

The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed and sent via an overnight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the two specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.

Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different laboratory, if requested by the player.

## BLOOD COLLECTION PROCEDURES

During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to occur after practices on non-game days, and after games on game day. Random tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.

When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection. After check-in, the player will be advised to take a 15-minute hydration period if immediately coming off the court.

The player will be asked to select two blood collection kits (one as a back-up) and another kit which will be used to transport the specimen. Collections will be performed by blood collection specialists (who are phlebotomists, registered and licensed nurses, medical assistants or paramedics).

The blood collection specialist shall collect a total of 10 ml of blood (approximately 1 tablespoon). The player's non-dominant arm will be used to make the initial blood draw attempt. If the blood draw is not possible or successful from the non-dominant arm, the dominant arm may be used. No more than three (3) attempts will be made to draw a blood specimen. After that, the collection will be discontinued. Upon completing the blood draw, the blood collection specialist will ensure that the draw site is not bleeding and bandage the site.

The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the specimens. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The two specimens will be sealed in a blood specimen bag, and sent via an overnight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the two specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.

Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different laboratory, if requested by the player.

## CREATION OF PLAYER LONGITUDINAL PROFILES

The following protocol will be used to create the Longitudinal Profiles described in Article XXXIII, Section 18 above:

1. **Step 1:** Beginning with the 2017-18 Season, the Program's drug collection company will assign each player a unique personal identification number. A player's personal identification number will remain the same for all periods of time he is covered by the Program, and will only be used for the purposes of the Longitudinal Profile. Other than to the designated representatives or employees within the drug collection company and the Laboratory, the drug collection company will not disclose the personal identification number that corresponds to the player's name to any individual other than one representative each of the NBA and the Players Association.

2. **Step 2:** The Laboratory (as defined in Article XXXIII, Section 18(a)) will maintain a secure, separate database for each player's personal identification number that contains his corresponding Testosterone concentration, epitestosterone concentration and Testosterone/Epitestosterone ("T/E") ratio (referred to collectively as the "Baseline Values"). This database will not contain any identifying information for the players.

3. **Step 3:** The Baseline Values will be calculated, pursuant to the Laboratory's operating standards, by averaging a player's T/E ratio, Testosterone concentration and Epitestosterone concentration, respectively, from three negative tests conducted under the Program. After a player's Baseline Values are established, those values will be considered a player's Longitudinal Profile for the duration of his coverage under the Program. New Baseline Values will be calculated for a player upon the recommendation of the director of the Laboratory.

4. **Step 4:** The Laboratory will compare the Baseline Values to the corresponding Specimen Values (as defined in Article XXXIII, Section 18(c)) in subsequent tests identified with a player's personal identification number in determining whether it will conduct IRMS analysis (as defined in Section 18(a) above) on a urine specimen.
